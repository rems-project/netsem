  For a duplicate ack:

  amusingly, see rfc1122p94: (g) Check ACK field, ESTABLISHED state, p. 72: The ACK is a duplicate
  if SEG.ACK =< SND.UNA (the = was omitted).  Similarly, the window should be updated if: SND.UNA =<
  SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT, because SND.UNA = SEG.ACK may mean an out-of-order segment was received, which
  uses buffer space.

  the check that data = [] is necessary to avoid triggering the retransmit logic when multiple data
  segments are received while no data is being transmitted.  All the acks in this case will be the
  same, but they are not duplicates!

  BSD Header Prediction - if the segment is either the next inorder data segment we are expecting,
                          or the pure ACK that we are expecting, then we do a fast-path processing
                          of the segment. This means that some things that usually happen later on
                          in tcp_input do not take place in this case, namely: 1) pulling rcv_up
                          along 2) send window updates (to snd_wnd, snd_wl1 etc.).
  MS: many of the conditions below may already be true due to other di3 stuff, but for now this is
      stated as per the BSD code in tcp_input.c::928-1039.

  On urgent data processing:

    FreeBSD 4.6 (and in fact Net/3) test if [[urp + LENGTH rcvq <= SB_MAX]] (which is 256K), and
    only accept an [[urp]] if this condition holds.  It's marked as a kludge, apparently to avoid
    crashing soreceive.

    Weird thing \#1: [[cb'.rcv_up]] is advanced to [[cb.rcv_nxt]] if there's no urgent pointer in
    this segment or we're not in the right state, but *NOT* if the test above fails; in that case,
    we just leave the [[rcv_up]] alone.  SB: agrees that our behaviour is correct. When the above
    test fails [[cb.rcv_up]] is pulled along with [[cb.rcv_nxt]] and [[cb.rcvurp]] is left alone
    until the new urgent pointer is within range.

    Weird thing \#2: we cannot see (on a very cursory look) why soreceive might crash.

    Weird thing \#3: [[urp]] can only be 64K, so it's highly unlikely the test would fail anyway.

    To make things a little bit less hairy, we ignore weird thing \#1 here.


  On data processing:

    is this data in-order or out-of-order or altogether out-of-window?

    does 'window' here mean the one we've currently advertised, or the space we actually have?
    arbitrarily, the former

    again, like URG, this only happens if not TCPS_HAVERCVDFIN, about which Keith and BSD have an
    ongoing debate

    Q: what happens if data arrives after a FIN?  Does the socket complain when TCP tries to add
    stuff to its receive queue?
    A: if we're in TIME_WAIT, then it gets ignored.  Dunno about other cases.

On all OSes, attempting to write to a closed socket yields an immediate error.  Only on Linux,
however, does [[sowriteable]] return [[T]] in this case.

On Linux, if the outgoing half of the connection has been closed by the application, the socket
becomes non-writeable, whereas on other OSes it becomes writeable (because an immediate error would
result from writing).

@internal

In our previous UDP specification, a UDP socket was writeable if the outqueue was not full; this is
not part of the host state in the present spec (TODO: really??), and so here we are simply always
writeable.  UNPp154 suggests that a UDP socket is always writable anyway.

@section [[accept]] TCP [[accept()]]
 \[ <[accept: fd -> fd * (ip * port)]> \]

  [[accept(fd)]] returns the next connection available on the completed connections queue for the
  listening TCP socket referenced by file descriptor [[fd]].  The returned file descriptor [[fd]]
  refers to the newly-connected socket; the returned [[ip]] and [[port]] are its remote address.
  [[accept()]] blocks if the completed connections queue is empty and the socket does not have the
  [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag set.

  Any pending errors on the new connection are ignored, except for [[ECONNABORTED]] which causes
  [[accept()]] to fail with [[ECONNABORTED]].

  Calling [[accept()]] on a UDP socket fails: UDP is not a connection-oriented protocol.

@errors

  A call to [[accept()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception
  is raised:

  @error [[EAGAIN]] The socket has the [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag set and no connections are available on
  the completed connections queue.

  @error [[ECONNABORTED]] The connection at the head of the completed connections queue has been
  aborted; the socket has been shutdown for reading; or the socket has been closed.

  @error [[EINVAL]] Ths socket is not accepting connections, \ie,  it is not in the [[LISTEN]] state,
  or is a UDP socket.

  @error [[EMFILE]] The maximum number of file descriptors allowed per process are already open for
  this process.

  @error [[EOPNOTSUPP]] The socket type of the specified socket does not support accepting
  connections. This error is raised if [[accept()]] is called on a UDP socket.

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENFILE]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOBUFS]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOMEM]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EINTR]]

@commoncases

  [[accept()]] is called and immediately returns a connection: [[accept_1]]; [[return_1]]

  [[accept()]] is called and blocks; a connection is completed and the call returns: [[accept_2]];

    WinXP:  &  |SOCKET accept(SOCKET s, struct sockaddr* addr, int* addrlen);| \\
  \end{tabular}\\

  In the Posix interface:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |socket| is the listening socket's file descriptor, corresponding to the [[fd]]
     argument of the model;

    \item the returned |int| is either non-negative, \ie,  a file descriptor referring to the
     newly-connected socket, or |-1| to indicate an error, in which case the error code is
     in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is indicated by a return value of
     |INVALID_SOCKET|, not |-1|, with the actual error code available through a
     call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

    \item |address| is a pointer to a |sockaddr| structure of length
    |address_len| corresponding to the [[ip*port]] returned by the model [[accept()]]. If
    |address| is not a null pointer then it stores the address of the peer for the accepted
    connection. For the model [[accept()]] it will actually be a |sockaddr_in| structure;
    the peer IP address will be stored in the |sin_addr.s_addr| field, and the peer port
    will be stored in the |sin_port| field. If |address| is a null pointer then the
    peer address is ignored, but the model [[accept()]] always returns the peer address. On input
    the |address_len| is the length of the |address| structure, and on output it is
    the length of the stored address.

  \end{itemize}


@modeldetails

  If the [[accept()]] call blocks then state [[Accept2(sid)]] is entered, where [[sid]] is the index
  of the socket that [[accept()]] was called upon.

  The following errors are not included in the model:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |EFAULT| signifies that the pointers passed as either the |address| or
     |address_len| arguments were inaccessible.  This is an artefact of the C interface to
     [[accept()]] that is excluded by the clean interface used in the model.

    \item |EPERM| is a Linux-specific error code described by the Linux man page as
     "Firewall rules forbid connection". This is outside the scope of what is modelled.

    \item |EPROTO| is a Linux-specific error code described by the man page as "Protocol
     error". Only TCP and UDP are modelled here; the only sockets that can exist in the model are
     bound to a known protocol.

    \item |WSAECONNRESET| is a WinXP-specific error code described in the MSDN page as "An
    incoming connection was indicated, but was subsequently terminated by the remote peer prior to
    accepting the call." This error has not been encountered in exhaustive testing.

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking
     Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback
     function". This is not modelled here.

  \end{itemize}


  From the Linux man page:
       Linux [[accept()]] passes already-pending network errors on the new socket as
       an error code from accept.  This behaviour differs from other BSD socket implementations.
       For reliable operation the application should detect the network errors defined for the
       protocol after accept and treat them like EAGAIN by retrying. In case of TCP/IP these are
       ENETDOWN, EPROTO, ENOPROTOOPT, EHOSTDOWN, ENONET, EHOSTUNREACH, EOPNOTSUPP, and
       ENETUNREACH.

       This is currently not modelled, but will be looked at when the Linux semantics are
       investigated.

   @description

   This rule covers two cases: (1) the completed connection queue is non-empty when [[accept(fd)]] is
   called from a thread [[tid]] in the [[Run]] state, where [[fd]] refers to a TCP socket [[sid]],
   and (2) a previous call to [[accept(fd)]] on socket [[sid]] blocked, leaving its calling thread
   [[tid]] in state [[Accept2(sid)]], and a new connection has become available.

   In either case the listening TCP socket [[sid]] has a connection [[sid']] at the head of its
   completed connections queue [[sid'::q]]. A socket entry for [[sid']] already exists in the host's
   finite map of sockets, [[socks]]$\oplus\dots$. The socket is [[ESTABLISHED]], is not shutdown for
   reading, and is only missing a file description association that would make it accessible via the
   sockets interface.

   A new file description record is created for connection [[sid']], indexed by a new [[fid']], and
   this is added to the host's finite map of file descriptions [[files]].  It is assigned a default
   set of file flags, [[ff_default]]. The socket entry [[sid']] is completed with its file
   association [[SOME fid']] and [[sid']] is removed from the head of the completed connections
   queue.

   When the listening socket [[sid]] is bound to a local IP address [[i1]], the accepted socket
   [[sid']] is also bound to it.

   Finally, the new file descriptor [[fd']] is created in an architecture-specific way using the
   auxiliary {@link [[nextfd]]}, and an entry mapping [[fd']] to [[fid']] is added to the host's finite map
   of file descriptors.  If the calling thread was previously blocked in state [[Accept2(sid)]] it
   proceeds via a [[Lh_tau]] transition, otherwise by a [[Lh_call(tid, (accept fd))]] transition.
   The thread is left in state [[Ret (OK (fd',(i2,p2)))]] to return the file descriptor and remote
   address of the accepted connection in response to the original [[accept()]] call.

   If the new socket [[sid']] has error [[ECONNABORTED]] pending in its error field [[es']], this is
   handled by rule [[accept_5]]. All other pending errors on [[sid']] are ignored, but left as the
   socket's pending error.

   @internal

   If the queue of completed connections is non-empty and the user either calls [[accept()]] or has
   already made a blocking call to [[accept()]] (and is therefore now in state [[Accept2]]), then a
   new open file description is allocated for the socket, and a new file descriptor made to point to
   the open file description.  Pending errors are ignored, except for [[ECONNABORTED]], of the
   provenance of which the present writer is uncertain (see [[accept_5]]).

   Note that cantsndmore is not constrained, because e.g. under BSD's "can listen() anywhere" feature,
   could have a listening socket with cantsndmore set that can still accept limited connections.

   This rule is a combination of (the old) [[accept_1]] and [[accept_1a]].  DISCUSSION POINT: is it
   clear?

   Notice that we require that the source ip and port are the same for the listening socket and the
   accepted socket.  I cannot see this in POSIX; needs to be checked with BSD and/or Linux.

   POSIX: "shall extract...".
   POSIX: "until a connection is present...".

   slow version SHOULD BE URGENT.

   Michael points out that we should check if we actually can allocate a fresh fd.

   SB: The linux man page reads: "Linux accept passes already-pending network errors on the new
   socket as an error code fom accept. This behaviour differs from the other BSD socket
   implementations..."

   This situation will arise only when a thread calls [[close()]] on the listening socket while

   socket which already had [[cantrcvmore]] set. The latter can occur in BSD, which allows

   under typical use.

   TODO: MF: I'm confused by this rule. (1) how does it interact with close_8 which closes a
   listening socket, and (2) if the socket is in state [[CLOSED]] how does it have a listen queue
   [[SOME lis]]?

   POSIX: "shall fail..." if "A connection has been aborted".  XSH2.10 says that this error is a
   pending error for a socket if a connection is *locally* aborted, but says no more than that.  See
   rationale.

   slow version SHOULD BE URGENT.

   http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/postfix/2001-03/0125.html (and lots of other hits for
   googling "ECONNABORTED") gives a discussion: it's a bit weird, but can happen if remote end
   closes before the connection is accepted.  It could be wrong behaviour.  In any case, this is not
   "local" as POSIX says.  Also note that EPROTO is sometimes returned when ECONNABORTED is meant.

   MS: this discussion appears to be dated - in particular (1) it refers to BSD 4.2, where we are using
   4.6, and (2) the code that the discussion refers to is most certainly *not* in 4.6. The only
   circumstances under which accept() returns ECONNABORTED are if:
     (1) The listening socket has cantrcvmore set.
     (2) The listening socket has state SS_ISDISCONNECTED (equating to being in CLOSED state).
   (note the second condition is only applicable if the user was already blocking on an accept()).

   Should the CLOSED state really have SOME i1', SOME p1?  Are is2 and ps2 specified too?

   It is not valid to call [[accept()]] on a socket that is not in the
   [[LISTEN]] state.

   This rule covers two cases: (1) on the non-listening TCP socket [[sid]], [[accept()]] is called
   from a thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, and (2) a previous call to [[accept()]] on
   TCP socket [[sid]] blocked because no completed connections were available, leaving thread
   [[tid]] in state [[Accept2(sid)]] and after the [[accept()]] call blocked the socket changed to a
   state other than [[LISTEN]].

   In the first case the [[accept(fd)]] call on socket [[sid]], referenced by file descriptor
   [[fd]], proceeds by a [[Lh_call(tid,accept(fd))]] transition and in the latter by a [[Lh_tau]]
   transition. In either case, the thread is left in state [[Ret (FAIL EINVAL)]] to return error
   [[EINVAL]] to the caller.

   The second case is subtle: a previous call to [[accept()]] may have blocked waiting for a new
   completed connection to arrive and an operation, such as a [[close()]] call, in another thread
   caused the socket to change from the [[LISTEN]] state.

   @internal

   If the user calls [[accept()]] on a socket that is not in the listening state, or the user has
   called this and is blocked in the [[Accept2]] state when the state of the socket changes out of

   In the first case the error is returned immediately ([[fast fail]]) by performing an

   In real systems, error [[EMFILE]] indicates that the calling process already has [[OPEN_MAX]] file

  port range is selected and assigned to the socket. Otherwise the port [[p]] specified in the bind
  call, [[bind(_,_,SOME p)]] forms part of the socket's local address.

  On some architectures a range of port values are designated to be privileged, e.g. 0-1023
  inclusive. If a call to [[bind()]] requests a port in this range and the caller does not have
  sufficient privileges the call will fail.

  A [[bind()]] call may or may not specify the IP address. If an IP address is not specified,
  [[bind(_,NONE,_)]], the socket's local IP address is set to [[NONE]] and it will receive segments
  or datagrams addressed to any of the host's local IP addresses and port [[p]]. Otherwise, the
  caller specifies a local IP address, [[bind(_,SOME i,_)]], the socket's local IP address is set
  to [[SOME i]], and it only receives segments or datagrams addressed to IP address [[i]] and port
  [[p]].

  A call to [[bind()]] may be unsuccessful if the requested IP address or port is unavailable to
  bind to, although in certain situations this can be overrriden by setting the socket option
  [[SO_REUSEADDR]] appropriately: see {@link [[bound_port_allowed]]}.

  A socket can only be bound once: it is not possible to rebind it to a different port later. A
  [[bind()]] call is not necessary for every socket: sockets may be autobound to an ephemeral port when a
  call requiring a port binding is made, e.g. [[connect()]].

@errors

  A call to [[bind()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception
  is raised:

  @error [[EACCES]] The specified port is in the privileged port range of the host architecture and
  the current thread does not have the required privileges to bind to it.

  @error [[EADDRINUSE]] The specified address is in use by or conflicts with the address of another
  socket using the same protocol. The error may occur in the following situations only:
    \begin{itemize}

      \item [[bind(_,_,SOME p)]] will fail with [[EADDRINUSE]] if another socket is bound to port
       [[p]]. This error may be preventable by setting the [[SO_REUSEADDR]] socket option.

      \item [[bind(_,SOME i,SOME p)]] will fail with [[EADDRINUSE]] if another socket is bound to
       port [[p]] and IP address [[i]], or is bound to port [[p]] and wildcard IP. This error will
       not occur if the [[SO_REUSEADDR]] option is correctly used to allow multiple sockets to be
       bound to the same local port.

    \end{itemize}
  This error is never returned from a call [[bind(_,_,NONE)]] that requests an autobound port.

  @error [[EADDRNOTAVAIL]] The specified IP address cannot be bound as it is not local to the host.

  @error [[EINVAL]] The socket is already bound to an address and the socket's protocol does not
  support rebinding to a new address. Multiple calls to [[bind()]] are not permitted.

  @error [[EISCONN]] The socket is connected and rebinding to a new local address is not
  permitted (TCP ONLY).

  @error [[ENOBUFS]] A port was not specified in the [[bind()]] call and autobinding failed because
  no ephemeral ports for the socket's protocol are currently available. In addition, on WinXP the
  error can signal that the host has insufficient available buffers to complete the operation.

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EBADF]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOTSOCK]]

@commoncases

  A server application creates a TCP socket and binds it to its local address. It is then put in the
  [[LISTEN]] state to accept incoming connections to this address: [[socket_1]]; [[return_1]];
  [[bind_1]]; [[return_1]]; [[listen_1]]

  A UDP socket is created and bound to its local address. [[recv()]] is called and the socket
  blocks, waiting to receive datagrams sent to the local address: [[socket_1]]; [[return_1]];
  [[bind_1]]; [[return_1]]; [[recv_12]]

@api

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:  &  |int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address,| \\
            &  |           socklen_t address_len);| \\
    FreeBSD:&  |int bind(int s, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);| \\
    Linux:  &  |int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);| \\
    WinXP:  &  |SOCKET bind(SOCKET s, const struct sockaddr* name, int namelen);| \\
  \end{tabular}\\

  In the Posix interface:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |socket| is the socket's file descriptor, corresponding to the [[fd]] argument of
     the model.

    \item |address| is a pointer to a |sockaddr| structure of size
    |socklen_t| containing the local IP address and port to be assigned to the socket,
    corresponding to the [[is]] and [[ps]] arguments of the model. For the |AF_INET|
    sockets used in the model, a |sockaddr_in| structure stores the address. The
    |sin_addr.s_addr| field holds the IP address; if it is set to |0| then the IP
    address is wildcarded: [[is=NONE]]. The |sin_port| field stores the port to bind to; if
    it is set to |0| then the port is wildcarded: [[ps=NONE]]. On WinXP a wildcard IP is
    specified by the constant |INADDR_ANY|, not |0|

    \item the returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
     indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is
     indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual
     error code available through a call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  The FreeBSD, Linux and WinXP interfaces are similar modulo some argument renaming, except where
  noted above.

  On Windows Socket 2 the |name| parameter is not necessarily interpreted as a pointer to a
  |sockaddr| structure but is cast this way for compatilibity with Windows Socket 1.1 and
  the BSD sockets interface. The service provider implementing the functionality can choose to
  interpret the pointer as a pointer to any block of memory provided that the first two bytes of the
  block start with the address family used to create the socket. The default WinXP internet family
  provider expects a |sockaddr| structure here. This change is purely an interface design
  choice that ultimately achieves the same functionality of providing a name for the socket and is
  not modelled.

@modeldetails

  The specification only models the {AF,PF}\_INET address families thus the address family field of
  the |struct sockaddr| argument to [[bind()]] and those errors specific to other address
  familes, e.g. UNIX domain sockets, are not modelled here.

  In the Posix specification, [[ENOBUFS]] may have the additional meaning of "Insufficient resources
  were available to complete the call". This is more general than the use of [[ENOBUFS]] in the
  model.

  The following errors are not modelled:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |EAGAIN| is BSD-specific and described in the man page as: "Kernel resources to
     complete the request are temporarily unavailable". This is not modelled here.


    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking
     Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback
     function". This is not modelled here.

    \item |EFAULT| signifies that the pointers passed as either the |address| or
     |address_len| arguments were inaccessible.  This is an artefact of the C interface to
     [[bind()]] that is excluded by the clean interface used in the model. On WinXP, the equivalent
     error |WSAEFAULT| in addition signifies that the name address format used in
     |name| may be incorrect or the address family in |name| does not match that of
     the socket.

    \item |ENOTDIR|, |ENAMETOOLONG|, |ENOENT|, |ELOOP|,
     |EIO| (BSD-only), |EROFS|, |EISDIR| (BSD-only), |ENOMEM|,
     |EAFNOTSUPPORT| (Posix-only) and |EOPNOTSUPP| (Posix-only) are errors specific
     to other address families and are not modelled here. None apply to WinXP as other address
     families are not available by default.

   @description

   The call [[bind(fd,is1,ps1)]] is perfomed on the TCP or UDP socket [[sid]] referenced by file
   descriptor [[fd]] from a thread [[tid]] in the [[Run]] state. The socket [[sid]] is currently
   uninitialised, i.e. it has no local or remote address defined [[(NONE,NONE,NONE,NONE)]], and it
   contains an uninitialised TCP or UDP protocol block, [[tcp_sock]] and [[udp_sock]] as appropriate for the socket's protocol.

   If an IP address is specified in the [[bind()]] call, i.e. [[is1 = SOME i1]], the call can only succeed
   if the IP address [[i1]] is one of those belonging to an interface of host [[h]], [[i1 IN
   local_ips(h0.ifds)]].

   The port [[p1]] that the socket will be bound to is determined by the auxiliary function
   [[autobind]] that takes as argument the port option [[ps1]] from the [[bind()]] call. If [[ps1 =
   SOME p]] [[autobind]] simply returns the singleton set [[{p}]], constraining the local port
   binding [[p1]] by [[p1 = p]]. Otherwise, [[autobind]] returns a set of available ephemeral ports
   and [[p1]] is constrained to be a port within the set.

   If a port is specified in the [[bind()]] call, i.e. [[ps1 = SOME p1]], either the port is not a
   privileged port [[p1 NOTIN privileged_ports]] or the host (actually, process) must have
   sufficient privileges [[h0.priv = T]].

   Not all requested bindings are permissible because other sockets in the system may be bound to
   the chosen address or to a conflicting address. To check the binding [[is1, SOME p1]] is
   permitted the auxiliary function [[bound_port_allowed]] is used. [[bound_port_allowed]] is
   architecture dependent and checks not only the other sockets bound locally to port [[p1]] on the
   host, but also the status of the socket flag [[SO_REUSEADDR]] for socket [[sid]] and the
   conflicting sockets. The use of the socket flag [[SO_REUSEADDR]] can permit sockets to share
   bindings under some circumstances, resolving the binding conflict. See {@link [[bound_port_allowed]]} for further information.

   The call proceeds by performing a [[Lh_call(tid,bind(fd,is1,ps1))]] transition returning [[OK()]]
   to the calling thread. Socket [[sid]] is bound to local address [[(is1,SOME p1)]]and the host has
   an updated list of bound sockets [[bound]] with socket [[sid]] at its head.

   @variation FreeBSD

   If [[sid]] is a TCP socket then it cannot be shutdown for writing: [[cantsndmore=F]], and its
   [[bsd_cantconnect]] flag cannot be set.

   @modeldetails

   The list of bound sockets [[bound]] is used by the model to determine the order in which sockets
   are bound. This is required to model ICMP message and UDP datagram delivery on Linux.

   @internal

   If a socket is closed, then calling [[bind()]] on it sets its local port (possibly by
   autobinding), and possibly its local IP.  If the local IP is set, it must be one of the IPs of
   the local host.  The IP,port pair must not already be bound.  Notice that if the IP is not
   specified here, it is left unset in the socket until a later [[connect()]] is performed.

   POSIX "shall assign ... to a socket ... that has no local socket address assigned."

   I'm assuming that rebinding, even as incremental binding (specifying an IP address, for example,
   when port already assigned) is not permitted.

   Note that it's not [[bind]]ing but [[listen]]ing that puts a socket on the [[bound]] list.  So
   perhaps this is a misnomer.

   We are no longer assuming all sockets/callers are unprivileged -- instead, we use the [[h.privs]]
   field to determine if the process has privilege.

@section [[close]] ALL [[close()]]
 \[ <[close: fd -> unit]> \]

  A call [[close(fd)]] closes file descriptor [[fd]] so that it no longer refers to a file
  description and associated socket. The closed file descriptor is made available for reuse by the
  process. If the file descriptor is the last file descriptor referencing a file description the
  file description itself is deleted and the underlying socket is closed. If the socket is a UDP
  socket it is removed.

  It is important to note the distinction drawn above: only closing the last file descriptor of a
  socket has an effect on the state of the file description and socket.

  The following behaviour may occur when closing the last file descriptor of a TCP socket:

  \begin{itemize}

   \item A TCP socket may have the [[SO_LINGER]] option set which specifies a maximum duration in
    seconds that a [[close(fd)]] call is permitted to block.
    \begin{itemize}

      \item In the normal case the [[SO_LINGER]] option is not set, the close call returns
       immediately and asynchronously sends any remaining data and gracefully closes the connection.

      \item If [[SO_LINGER]] is set to a non-zero duration, the [[close(fd)]] call will block while
       the TCP implementation attempts to successfully send any remaining data in the socket's send
       buffer and gracefully close the connection. If the sending of remaining data and the graceful
       close are successful within the set duration, [[close(fd)]] returns successfully, otherwise
       the linger timer expires, [[close(fd)]] returns an error [[EAGAIN]], and the close operation
       continues asychronously, attempting to send the remaining data.

      \item The [[SO_LINGER]] option may be set to zero to indicate that [[close(fd)]] should be
       abortive. A call to [[close(fd)]] tears down the connection by emitting a reset segment to
       the remote end (abandoning any data remaining in the socket's send queue) and returns
       successfully without blocking.


    \end{itemize}

   \item If [[close(fd)]] is called on a TCP socket in a pre-established state the file description
    and socket are simply closed and removed, regardless of how [[SO_LINGER]] is set, except on
    Linux platforms where [[SYN_RECEIVED]] is dealt with as an established state for the purposes of
    [[close(fd)]].

   \item Calling [[close(fd)]] on a listening TCP socket closes and removes the socket and aborts
    each of the connections on the socket's pending and completed connection queues.

  \end{itemize}

@errors

  A call to [[close()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception is
  raised:

  @error [[EAGAIN]] The linger timer expired for a lingering [[close()]] call and the socket has not
  yet been successfully closed.

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EBADF]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOTSOCK]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EINTR]]

@commoncases

  A TCP socket is created and connected to a peer; other socket calls are made, most likely [[send()]] and
  [[recv()]], but the [[SO_LINGER]] option is not set. [[close()]] is then called and the connection
  is gracefully closed: [[socket_1]]; $\dots $; [[close_2]]

  A UDP socket is created and socket calls are made on it, mostly [[send()]] and [[recv()]] calls;
  the socket is then closed: [[socket_1]]; $\dots $; [[close_10]]

@api

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:  &  |int close(int fildes);| \\
    FreeBSD:&  |int close(int d);| \\
    Linux:  &  |int close(int fd);| \\
    WinXP:  &  |int closesocket(SOCKET s);| \\
  \end{tabular}\\

  In the Posix interface:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |fildes| is the file descriptor to close, corresponding to the [[fd]] argument of
    the model [[close()]].

    \item the returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
    indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is
    indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual
    error code available through a call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  The FreeBSD, Linux and WinXP interfaces are similar modulo argument renaming, except where
  noted above.

@modeldetails

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item In Posix and on FreeBSD and Linux, |EIO| means an I/O error occurred while reading from or
    writing to the file system.  Since we model only sockets, not file systems, we do not model this
    error.

    \item On FreeBSD, |ENOSPC| means the underlying object did not fit, cached data was
    lost.

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking
     Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback
     function". This is not modelled here.

  \end{itemize}

    @description

    A [[close(fd)]] call is performed where [[fd]] refers to either a TCP or UDP socket. At least
    two file descriptors refer to file description [[fid]], [[fid_ref_count(fds,fid) > 1]], of which
    one is [[fd]], [[fid = fds ' fd]].

    The [[close(fd)]] call proceeds by a [[Lh_call(tid,close(fd))]] transition leaving the host in
    the successful return state [[Ret (OK())]]. In the final host state, the mapping of file
    descriptor [[fd]] to file descriptor index [[fid]] is removed from the file descriptors finite
    map [[fds' = fds \\ fd]] , effectively reducing the reference count of the file description by
    one. The [[close()]] call does not alter the socket's state as other file descriptors still
    refer to the socket through file description [[fid]].

    @internal

    If the user calls [[close()]], but there is more than one file descriptor for this open file
    description, the file descriptor is freed but no further action is taken.

    POSIX "shall deallocate...".

    UNPv1p191 table implies that even if this is not the last [[fd]], the flags [[cantsndmore]] and
    [[cantrcvmore]] should be set.  We have not verified whether or not this is the case.  A quick
    look at BSD source suggests that UNPv1 is bogus here, and nothing interesting happens until the
    last fd for a socket is closed.  (or else how could you renumber an fd for a socket safely??).
    SB: UNPv1p191 is incorrect.

    @description

    A [[close(fd)]] call is performed on the TCP socket [[sid]] referenced by file descriptor [[fd]]
    which is the only file descriptor referencing the socket's file description:
    [[fid_ref_count(fds,fid) = 1]]. The TCP socket [[sid]] is in a synchronised state, i.e. a state
    [[>= ESTABLISHED]], or on Linux it may be in the [[SYN_RECEIVED]] state.

    In the common case the socket's linger option is not set, [[sf.t(SO_LINGER) = time_infty]], and
    regardless of whether the socket is in non-blocking mode or not, i.e. [[ff.b(O_NONBLOCK)]] is
    unconstrained, the call to [[close()]] proceeds successfully without blocking.

    On all platforms except for Linux, if the socket is in non-blocking mode [[ff.b(O_NONBLOCK) =
    T]] the linger option may be set with a positive duration: [[sf.t(SO_LINGER) <> time_zero)]]. In
    this case the option is ignored giving precedence to the socket's non-blocking semantics. The
    [[close()]] call succeeds without blocking.

    The [[close(fd)]] call proceeds by a [[Lh_call(tid,close(fd))]] transition leaving the host in
    the successful return state [[Ret (OK())]]. The final socket is marked as unable to send and
    receive further data, [[cantsndmore = T /\ cantrcvmore = T]], eventually causing TCP to transmit
    all remaining data in the socket's send queue and perform a graceful close.

    In the final host state, the mapping of file descriptor [[fd]] to file descriptor index [[fid]]
    is removed from the file descriptors finite map [[fds' = fds \\ fd]] and the file description
    entry [[fid]] is removed from the finite map of file descriptors [[files \\ fid]]. The socket
    entry itself, [[(sid,Sock(SOME fid,]]$\dots $,[[))]] is not destroyed at this point; it remains
    until the TCP connection has been successfully closed.

    @variation Linux

    The socket can be in the [[SYN_RECEIVED]] state or in one of the synchronised states [[>=
    ESTABLISHED]].

    On Linux, non-blocking semantics do not take precedence over the [[SO_LINGER]] option, i.e. if
    the socket is non-blocking, [[ff.b(O_NONBLOCK) = T]] and a linger option is set to a non-zero
    value, [[sf.t(SO_LINGER) <> time_zero]], the socket may block on a call to [[close()]]. See also
    {@link [[close_4]]}.

    @internal

    If the user calls [[close()]], and this is the only file descriptor referring to the open file
    description, and that open file description refers to a socket that is connected (i.e., in the
    [[ESTABLISHED]] state), and either the linger option is not set, or is set to something nonzero
    and [[O_NONBLOCK]] is set, then we free the file descriptor and open file description, set the
    [[cantsndmore]] flag to indicate that the end of [[sndq]] is EOF (causing [[deliver_out_*]] to
    eventually send a [[FIN]]), strip everything from [[rcvq]], and set [[cantrcvmore]] to arrange
    that recv() returns 0 rather than blocks, and return.

    POSIX "When all file descriptors associated ... are closed, any data remaining in the pipe or
    FIFO special file shall be discarded.  ... the open file description shall be freed."

    (unclear whether the first sentence applies to sockets too).

    I'm assuming too that the XSR streams stuff in the POSIX page does not apply.

    "If [fd] refers to a socket ... the socket [shall be] destroyed.  If the socket is in
    connection-mode, and the [[SO_LINGER]] option is set for the socket with non-zero linger time,
    and the socket has untransmitted data, then close shall block for up to the current linger
    interval until all data is transmitted."

    !! TCPv2p473 says 0 linger time means wait forever.  TCPv2p1019 seems to disagree.

    Three cases in the C API: [[SO_LINGER]] may be (a) not set, (b) set to zero, (c) set to
    non-zero.  We model these respectively by setting the time value of the option as follows: (a)
    infinity, (b) zero, (c) non-zero.

    See UNPv1p187 for the semantics of [[SO_LINGER]]: sometimes we should immediately generate a
    RST.

    Keith observes: there's now no way to remove that sock from h.socks; no way to access it from
    the program.  Eventually it will move to TIME\_WAIT and then to CLOSED; should not it be made to
    evaporate?  Seems messy to accumulate garbage in this way.  OTOH, think it's probably not (very)
    observable.

    @description

    A [[close(fd)]] call is performed on the TCP socket [[sid]] referenced by file descriptor [[fd]]
    which is the only file descriptor referencing the socket's file description:
    [[fid_ref_count(fds,fid) = 1]]. The TCP socket [[sid]] is in a synchronised state, i.e. a state >=
    [[ESTABLISHED]], except on Linux platforms where it may be in the [[SYN_RECEIVED]] state.

    The socket's linger option is set to a duration of zero, [[sf.t(SO_LINGER) = time_zero]], to signify
    that an abortive closure of socket [[sid]] is required.

    The [[close(fd)]] call proceeds by a [[Lh_call(tid,close(fd))]] transition leaving the host in
    the successful return state [[Ret (OK())]]. A reset segment [[seg]] is constructed from the
    socket's control block [[cb]] and address quad [[(i1,i2,p1,p2)]] and is appended to the host's
    output queue, [[oq]], by the function {@link [[enqueue_and_ignore_fail]]}, to create new output queue
    [[oq']]. The [[enqueue_and_ignore_fail]] function always succeeds; if it is not possible to add
    the reset segment [[seq]] to the output queue the corresponding error code is ignored and the
    reset segment is not queued for transmission.

    The mapping of file descriptor [[fd]] to index [[fid]] is removed from the file descriptors
    finite map [[fds' = fds \\ fd]] and the file description entry indexed by [[fid]] is removed
    from the finite map of file descriptions. The socket is put in the [[CLOSED]] state, shutdown
    for reading and writing, has its control block reset, and its send and receive queues emptied;
    this is done by the auxiliary function {@link [[tcp_close]]}. Additionally, its file description
    field is cleared.

    which is the only file descriptor referencing the socket's file description:
    [[fid_ref_count(fds,fid) = 1]]. The TCP socket [[sid]] has a blocking mode of operation,

    On Linux, the socket is also permitted to be in the [[SYN_RECEIVED]] state and it may have
    non-blocking semantics [[ff.b(O_NONBLOCK) = T]], because the linger option takes precedence over
    non-blocking semantics.

    The socket's linger option is set to a positive duration and is neither zero (which signifies an
    immediate abortive close of the socket) nor infinity (which signifies that the linger option has
    not been set), [[sf.t(SO_LINGER) NOTIN {time_zero; time_infty}]]. The close call blocks for a
    maximum duration that is the linger option duration in seconds, during which time TCP attempts
    to send all remaining data in the socket's send buffer and gracefully close the connection.

    The [[close(fd)]] call proceeds by a [[Lh_call(tid,close(fd))]] transition leaving the host in
    the blocked state [[Close2(sid)]].  The socket is marked as unable to send and receive

    A previous call to [[close()]] with the linger option set on the socket blocked leaving thread
    [[tid]] in the [[Close2(sid)]] state. The socket [[sid]] has successfully transmitted all the
    data in its send queue, [[sndq = []]], and has completed a graceful close of the connection: [[st
    IN {TIME_WAIT; CLOSED; FIN_WAIT_2}]].

    The rule proceeds via a [[Lh_tau]] transition leaving thread [[tid]] in the [[Ret(OK ())]]
    state to return successfully from the blocked [[close()]] call. The socket remains in a closed state.

    Note that the asychronous sending of any remaining data in the send queue and graceful closing of
    the connection is handled by other rules. This rule applies once these events have reached a
    successful conclusion.

    @internal

    (Originally thought navely: if [[sndq=[] /\ cantsndmore=T]] then we must have sent a FIN to the
    peer (we depend on this in the close rule that returns from a lingering close).  Hmm.  Not at
    all sure about this.  We do not want to return from a lingering close until we receive the ACK of
    the FIN we sent (K thinks this is the Right Way, it remains to be seen if UCB agreed with him.
    Alternative is to return from lingering close when received ACK of last data byte, as UNPv1p187.
    Looking at the BSD source for soclose etc suggests we check SS\_ISCONNECTED, which presumably
    has something to do TCP state rather than data emission); it's hard to see if this has happened
    from the socket state we have.  K thinks that soisdisconnected is called whenever we move to
    [[FIN_WAIT_2]] or [[TIME_WAIT]], and this clears SS\_ISCONNECTED.)

    SB: added the [[CLOSED]] state as this is entered after a succussful close from [[LAST_ACK]].

    If the data is successfully transmitted, as indicated by reaching a final state, return from the
    [[close()]] call.

    "If [fd] refers to a socket ... the socket [shall be] destroyed.  If the socket is in
    connection-mode, and the [[SO_LINGER]] option is set for the socket with non-zero linger time,
    and the socket has untransmitted data, then close shall block for up to the current linger
    interval until all data is transmitted."

    THIS RULE IS URGENT.

    @description

    A previous call to [[close()]] with the linger option set on the socket blocked, leaving thread
    [[tid]] in the [[Close2(sid)]] state. The linger timer has expired, [[timer_expires d]], before
    the socket has been successfully closed: [[st NOTIN {TIME_WAIT; CLOSED}]].

    The rule proceeds via a [[Lh_tau]] transition leaving thread [[tid]] in the [[Ret(FAIL EAGAIN)]]
    state to return error [[EAGAIN]] from the blocked [[close()]] call. The socket remains in a
    synchronised state and is not destroyed until the socket has been successfully closed by future
    asychronous events.


    The asychronous transmission of any remaining data in the send queue and the graceful closing of
    the connection is handled by other rules. This rule is only predicated on the unsuccessfulness
    of these operations, i.e. [[st NOTIN {TIME_WAIT; CLOSED}]]. When the linger timer expires the
    socket could be (a) still attempting to successfully transmit the data in the send queue, or (b)
    be someway through the graceful close operation. The exact state of the socket is not important
    here, explaining the relatively unconstrained socket state in the rule.

    @internal

    If the data is not successfully transmitted by the time the linger timer expires, return an
    error from the [[close()]] call.  We throw away any remaining data at this point (thus sending a
    FIN to the remote end, rather than a RST, even though we have not done a normal close - !!).
    This is the implication of UNPv1p188, but it seems unlikely.

    TODO: Hmm, in several of these, I should not be so strict on the Sock state.  For example, does
    it need to have an attached [[fid]] at this point?

    @variation Linux

    The rule does not apply if the socket is in state [[SYN_RECEIVED]]: for the purposes of
    [[close()]] this is treated as a synchronised state on Linux.


    Note that the socket [[sock]] is not in a synchronised state and thus has no data in its send queue ready
    for transmission. Closing an unsynchronised socket simply involves deleting the socket entry and
    removing all references to it. These operations are performed immediately by the rule, hence the
    socket's [[SO_LINGER]] option is not constrained because it has no effect regardless of how it
    may be set.

    @internal

    If the user calls [[close()]] on a socket that is in the closed state, we free the socket, open
    file description, and file descriptor.  We do the same for [[SYN_SENT]], as one can easily see
    by reading the BSD source code.

    SB believes closing a [[SYN_RECEIVED]] socket has the same behaviour, except on Linux.

    Easy case; have not opened a connection anyway.

    Keith at one time thought, in a POSIXy fashion, that this was sensible:

    If the user calls [[close()]] on a socket in the [[SYN_SENT]] state (i.e., it has asked TCP to
    initiate a connection but not yet received a response), we free the open file description and
    file descriptor, and move to the [[Close1]] state to send the FIN and free the socket (see
    [[close_2a]]).

    @description

    A [[close(fd)]] call is performed on the TCP socket [[sock]] referenced by file descriptor
    [[fd]] which is the only file descriptor referencing the socket's file description [[fid]],
    [[fid_ref_count(fds,fid) = 1]]. Socket [[sock]] is locally bound to port [[p1]] and one or more
    local IP addresses [[is1]], and is in the [[LISTEN]] state.

    The listening socket [[sock]] may have [[ESTABLISHED]] incoming connections on its connection
    queue [[lis.q]] and incomplete incoming connection attempts on queue [[lis.q0]]. Each
    connection, regardless of whether it is complete or not, is represented by a [[socket]]
    entry in [[h.socks]] and its corresponding index [[sid]] is on the respective queue. These
    connections have not been accepted by any thread through a call to [[accept()]] and are dropped
    on the closure of socket [[sock]].

    A set of reset seqments [[rsts_to_go]] is created using the auxiliary function
    {@link [[make_rst_segment_from_cb]]} for each of the sockets referenced by both queues. This is
    performed by looking up each socket [[sock']] for every [[sid']] in the concatentation of both
    queues, [[APPEND lis.q0 lis.q]], and extracting their address quads
    [[(sock'.is1,sock'.is2,sock'.ps1,sock'.ps2)]] and control blocks [[cb]] for use by
    [[make_rst_segment_from_cb]].

    The set of reset segments [[rsts_to_go]] is constrained to a list, [[segs]], and  queued by
    the auxiliary function [[enqueue_each_and_ignore_fail]] on the hosts output queue [[h.oq]].  The
    [[enqueue_each_and_ignore_fail]] function always succeeds; if it is not possible to add any of
    the reset segments [[segs]] to the output queue [[h.oq]], the corresponding error codes are
    ignored and the reset segments in error are ultimately not queued for transmission. This is
    sensible behaviour as the sockets for these connections are about to be deleted: if a reset
    segment does not successfully abort the remote end of the connection, perhaps because it could
    not be transmitted in the first place, any future incoming segments should not match any other
    socket in the system and will be dropped.

    The [[close(fd)]] call proceeds by a [[Lh_call(tid,close(fd))]] transition leaving the host in
    the successful return state [[Ret (OK ())]].

    In the final host state, the mapping of file descriptor [[fd]] to file descriptor index [[fid]]
    is removed from the file descriptors finite map [[fds' = fds \\ fd]] and file description entry
    [[fid]] is removed from the finite map of file descriptors [[h.files]]. The socket entry
    [[sock]] is removed from the hosts finite map of sockets [[h.socks]] and the socket's [[sid]]
    value is removed from the host's list of listening sockets [[h.listen]] by [[listen' = FILTER
    (\sid'. sid' <> sid) listen]]. Finally, all the sockets in [[h.socks]] that were referenced on
    one of the queues [[lis.q0]] and [[lis.q]], are removed by [[socks' = DRESTRICT socks { sid' | sid' NOTIN APPEND lis.q0 lis.q}]] as they were not accepted by any thread before socket [[sock]]
    was closed.

    @modeldetails

    The local IP address option [[is1]] of the socket [[sock]] is not constrained in this
    rule. Instead it is constrained by other rules for [[bind()]] and [[listen()]] prior to the
    socket entering the [[LISTEN]] state.

    @internal

    If the user calls [[close()]] on a socket in the listening state, we free the socket, open file
    description, and file descriptor, and remove the socket from the list of listening sockets.
    Further, abort each lis.q0 entry and each lis.q entry: for each, do [[tcp_drop_and_close]],
    i.e., RST if [[SYN_RECEIVED]] or later (else nothing), and drop the tcpcb.

    On checking the BSD code: BSD sockets layer calls [[soabort()]] on each socket in each of the
    two queues.  [[tcp_usr_abort()]] is the protocol routine; it calls [[tcp_drop()]] with
    [[ECONNABORTED]].  This function is just our [[tcp_drop_and_close]].  The code above has the
    same effect; most of what [[tcp_drop_and_close]] does is invisible for these sockets, because
    they truly go away.

(*:

@section [[connect]] ALL [[connect()]]
 \[ <[connect: fd * ip * port option -> unit]> \]

  A call to [[connect(fd,ip,port)]] attempts to connect a TCP socket to a peer, or to set the peer
  address of a UDP socket.
  Here [[fd]] is a file descriptor referring to a socket,
  [[ip]] is the peer IP address to connect to, and [[port]] is the peer port.

  If [[fd]] refers to a TCP socket then TCP's connection establishment protocol, often called the
  \textit{three-way handshake}, will be used to connect the socket to the peer specified by
  [[(ip,port)]]. A peer port must be specified: [[port]] cannot be set to [[NONE]]. There must be a
  listening TCP socket at the peer address, otherwise the connection attempt will fail with an
  [[ECONNRESET]] or [[ECONNREFUSED]] error. The local socket must be in the [[CLOSED]] state: attempts to
  [[connect()]] to a peer when already synchronised with another peer will fail. To start
  the connection establishment attempt, a [[SYN]] segment will be constructed, specifying the
  initial sequeunce number and window size for the connection, and possibly the maximum segment
  size, window scaling, and timestamping.  The segment is then
  enqueued on the host's out-queue; if this fails then the [[connect()]] call fails, otherwise
  connection establishment proceeds.

  If the socket is a blocking one (the [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag for [[fd]] is not set), then the call
  will block until the connection is established, or a timeout expires in which case the error
  [[ETIMEDOUT]] is returned.

  If the socket is non-blocking (the [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is set for [[fd]]), then the [[connect()]]
  call will fail with an [[EINPROGRESS]] error (or [[EALREADY]] on WinXP), and connection
  establishment will proceed asynchronously.

  Calling [[connect()]] again will indicate the current status of the connection establishment in
  the returned error: it will fail with [[EALREADY]] if the connection has not been established,
  [[EISCONN]] once the connection has been established, or if the connection establishment failed,
  an error describing why. Alternatively, [[pselect([],[fd],[],NONE,_)]] can be used; it will return
  when [[fd]] is ready for writing which will be when connection establishment is complete, either
  successfully or not. On Linux, unsetting the [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag for [[fd]] and then calling
  [[connect()]] will block until the connection is established or fails; for WinXP the call will
  fail with [[EALREADY]] and the connection establishment will be performed asynchronously still;
  for FreeBSD the call will fail with [[EISCONN]] even if the connection has not been established.

  Upon completion of connection establishment the socket will be in state [[ESTABLISHED]], ready to
  send and receive data, or [[CLOSE_WAIT]] if it received a FIN segment during connection
  establishment.

  On FreeBSD, if connection establishment fails having sent a [[SYN]] then further connection
  establishment attempts are not allowed; on Linux and WinXP further attempts are possible.

  If [[fd]] refers to a UDP socket then the peer address of the socket is set, but no connection is
  made. The peer address is then the default destination address for subsequent [[send()]] calls
  (and the only possible destination address on FreeBSD), and only datagrams with this source
  address will be delivered to the socket. On FreeBSD the peer port must be specified: a call to
  [[connect(fd,ip,NONE)]] will fail with an [[EADDRNOTAVAIL]] error; on Linux and WinXP such a call
  succeeds: datagrams from any port on the host with IP address [[ip]] will be delivered to the
  socket. Calling [[connect()]] on a UDP socket that already has a peer address set is allowed: the
  peer address will be replaced with the one specified in the call. On FreeBSD if the socket has a
  pending error, that may be returned when the call is made, and the peer address will also be set.

  In order for a socket to connect to a peer or have its peer address set, it must be bound to a
  local IP and port. If it is not bound to a local port when the [[connect()]] call is made, then it
  will be autobound: an unused port for the socket's protocol in the host's ephemeral port range is
  selected and assigned to the socket. If the socket does not have its local IP address set then it
  will be bound to the primary IP address of an interface which has a route to the peer. If the
  socket does have a local IP address set then the interface that this IP address will be the
  one used to connect to the peer; if this interface does not have a route to the peer then for a
  TCP socket the [[connect()]] call will fail when the SYN is enqueued on the host's outqueue; for a
  UDP socket the call will  fail on FreeBSD, whereas on Linux and WinXP the [[connect()]] call will
  succeed but later [[send()]] calls to the peer will fail.

  For a TCP socket, its binding quad must be unique: there can be no other socket in the host's
  finite map of sockets with the same binding quad. If the [[connect()]] call would result in two
  sockets having the same binding quad then it will fail with an [[EADDRINUSE]] error. For UDP
  sockets the same is true on FreeBSD, but on Linux and WinXP multiple sockets may have the same
  address quad. The socket that matching datagrams are delivered to is architecture-dependent: see
  {@link [[lookup]]}.


@errors

  is raised:

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:  &  |int connect(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len);| \\
    FreeBSD:&  |int connect(int s, const struct sockaddr *name, socklen_t namelen);| \\
    Linux:  &  |int connect(int sockfd, constr struct sockaddr *serv_addr, socklen_t addrlen);| \\
    WinXP:  &  |int connect(SOCKET s, const struct sockaddr* name, int namelen);| \\
  \end{tabular}\\

  In the Posix interface:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |socket| is a file descriptor referring to the socket to make a connection on,
    corresponding to the [[fd]] argument of the model [[connect()]].

    \item |address| is a pointer to a |sockaddr| structure of length
    |address_len| specifying the peer to connect to. |sockaddr| is a generic socket
    address structure: what is used for the model [[connect()]] is an internet socket
    address structure |sockaddr_in|. The |sin_family| member is set to
    |AF_INET|; the |sin_port| is the port to connect to, corresponding to the
    [[port]] argument of the model [[connect()]]: |sin_port = 0| corresponds to
    [[port=NONE]] and |sin_port=p| corresponds to [[port = SOME p]]; the
    |sin_addr.s_addr| member of the structure corresponds to the [[ip]] argument of the
    model [[connect()]].

   \item the returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
     indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is
     indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual
     error code available through a call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  The FreeBSD, Linux and WinXP interfaces are similar modulo argument renaming, except where
  noted above.

  Note: For UDP sockets, the Winsock Reference says "The default destination can be changed by
  simply calling connect again, even if the socket is already connected. Any datagrams queued for
  receipt are discarded if name is different from the previous connect." This is not the
  case.

@modeldetails

  If the call blocks then the thread enters state [[Connect2(sid)]] where [[sid]] is the identifier
  of the socket attempting to establish a connection.

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |EAFNOSUPPORT| means that the specified address is not a valid address for the
    address family of the specified socket. The model [[connect()]] only models the
    |AF_INET| family of addresses so this error cannot occur.

    \item |EFAULT| signifies that the pointers passed as either the |address| or
     |address_len| arguments were inaccessible.  This is an artefact of the C interface to
     [[connect()]] that is excluded by the clean interface used in the model.

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking
     Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback
     function". This is not modelled here.

    \item |EINVAL| is a Posix-specific error signifying that the |address_len|
    argument is not a valid length for the socket's address family or invalid address family in the
    |sockaddr| structure. The length of the address to connect to is implicit in the model
    [[connect()]], and only the |AF_INET| family of addresses is modelled so this error
    cannot occur.

   \item |EPROTOTYPE| is a Posix-specific error meaning that the specified address has a
   different type than the socket bound to the specified peer address. This error does not occur in
   any of the implementations as TCP and UDP sockets are dealt with seperately.

   \item |EACCES|, |ELOOP|, and |ENAMETOOLONG| are errors dealing with Unix
   domain sockets which are not modelled here.

  \end{itemize}

   @description

   From thread [[tid]], a [[connect(fd,i2,SOME p2)]] call is made where [[fd]] refers to a TCP
   socket. The socket is in state [[CLOSED]] with no peer address set, no pending error, and not
   shutdown for reading or writing. A [[SYN]] segment is created to being connection establishment,
   and is enqueued on the host's out-queue.

   If the socket is a blocking one (its [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is not set) then the call will block: a
   [[Lh_call(tid,connect(fd,i2,SOME p2))]] transition is made, leaving the thread state
   [[Connect2(sid)]]. If the socket is non-blocking (its [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is set) and the segment
   enqueuing was successful then the call will fail: a [[Lh_call(tid,connect(fd,i2,SOME p2))]]
   transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret (FAIL EINPROGRESS)]] (or [[Ret (FAIL
   EAGAIN)]] on WinXP); connection establishment will proceed asynchronously. Otherwise, if the enqueueing did not succeed, the call will fail with an
   error [[err]]: a [[Lh_call(tid,connect(fd,i2,SOME p2))]] transition is made, leaving the thread
   in state [[Ret (FAIL err)]].

   For further details see the in-line comments above.


   @variation FreeBSD

   The socket may also be in state [[TIME_WAIT]] when the [[connect()]] call is made, with either
   both its peer IP and port set, or neither set.

   The socket may be shutdown for reading when the [[connect()]] call is made.

   @variation WinXP

   If there is an early buffer allocation failure when enqueuing the segment, then it will not be
   placed on the host's out-queue and [[es' = ENOBUFS]]; the socket's control block will be [[cb']]
   with its [[snd_nxt]] and [[snd_max]] fields set to the intial sequence number, its
   [[last_ack_seen]] and [[rcv_adv]] fields set to [[0]], its [[tt_delack]] option set to [[NONE]],
   its [[tt_rexmt]] timer stopped, and its [[tf_rxwin0sent]] and [[t_rttseg]] fields reset.

   If there is no route from an interface specified by the local IP address [[i1]] to the foreign IP
   address [[i2]] then the socket's control block will be [[cb']] with its [[snd_next]] field set to the
   initial sequence number, its [[last_ack_sent]] and [[rcv_adv]] fields set to [[0]], and its
   [[tt_delack]] option set to [[NONE]].

   If the segment would case a loopback packet to be sent on the wire then the socket's control
   block will be [[cb']].

   @internal

   If the user calls [[connect()]] on a socket in the closed state, the socket is autobound if no
   local port was specified before, and if no local IP was specified before then an IP is chosen
   that belongs to the interface from which packets for the given destination will be sent.  Then
   the socket moves to the [[SYN_SENT]] state, and we move to the [[Connect2]] state to wait for the
   connection request to succeed or fail.


   POSIX: "If the socket has not already been bound... shall bind it...".

   POSIX: we consider particularly the "If the initiating socket is connection-mode" paragraph.

   So if [[is1]] is NONE, where exactly does it get filled in?  I'm assuming here, for now.

   We go into [[SYN_SENT]] immediately, to avoid a race between the actual connection initiation and
   another thread doing a [[connect()]].

   This is a kind-of blocking rule, except that the timer on the intermediate state is zero,
   requiring it to happen immediately (but not necessarily at the next transition!!).

   --comments from connect\_1a--

   The connection initiation continues by sending a request to the network to create a
   [[tcpInitiator]] object.

   POSIX: we consider particularly the "If the initiating socket is connection-mode" paragraph.

   POSIX: "[[connect()]] shall block for up to an unspecified timeout interval...".

   --comments from connect\_1b--

   TCP is incapable of establishing the connection immediately (ever!), so if the connect() call was
   nonblocking, we send the request to the network to create a [[tcpInitiator]] object, but then
   fail immediately, with the "error" indicating that the connection request is in progress.

   POSIX: "If the connection cannot be established immediately and O\_NONBLOCK is
   set... [[connect()]] shall fail ... [[EINPROGRESS]], but the connection request shall not be
   aborted, and the connection shall be established asynchronously.


   --OLD DESCRIPTION--

   From thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[connect(fd,i2,SOME p2)]] call is
   made. [[fd]] refers to a TCP socket identified by [[sid]] with address quad
   [[(is1,ps1,is2,ps2)]]. The socket is uninitialised: it is in state [[CLOSED]] with control block
   [[cb]], empty send and receive queues, no urgent pointers set, no out-of-band data, does not have
   a peer address set, [[is2=NONE /\ ps2=NONE]], has no pending error, and is not shutdown for
   reading or writing.

   The socket either has its local IP address set to [[i1']], or there is an IP address [[i1']] for
   one of the host's interfaces that has a route to the host with IP address [[i2]]. If the socket
   is not bound to a local port [[p1']] then it can be autobound to a local port [[p1']] using
   {@link [[autobind]]}.There are no other TCP sockets in the host's finite map of sockets,
   [[h.socks]], with the binding quad [[(SOME i1',SOME p1',SOME i2, SOME p2)]].

   [[seg]] is a [[SYN]] segment to initiate connection establishment with:

   \begin{itemize}

   \item source address (i1',p1') and destination address (i2,p2);

   \item an initial sequence number for the connection, [[iss]];

   \item the [[SYN]] flag set;

   \item the receive window set to [[rcv_wnd]]. [[rcv_wnd0]] is a window value between [[0]] and
   [[TCP_MAXWIN]]. If the window scale option is to be requested for the connection
   ([[request_r_scale=SOME n]]) then [[rcv_wnd]] is [[rcv_wnd0]] scaled by the window scale value
   specified by [[request_r_scale]] and clipped to a 16-bit value; if window scaling is not to be
   requested ([[request_r_scale=NONE]]) then [[rcv_wnd = rcv_wnd0]]. Additionally, [[rcv_wnd]] is
   not greater than the size of the socket's receive buffer: [[rcv_wnd <= sf.n(SO_RCVBUF)]].

   \item If [[advmss'=SOME v]] then the maximum segment size, [[v]] will be sent with the [[SYN]];

   \item if time-stamping is to be requested for the connection, [[tf_req_tstmp'=T]], then a
   timestamp will be included in the TCP options, specifying the current time and, as this is a
   [[SYN]], an echo reply value of [[0]].

   \item The [[URG]], [[ACK]], [[PSH]], [[RST]], and [[FIN]] flags are not set, and the
   acknowledgement number and urgent pointer are set to arbitrary values.

   \end{itemize}

   If there is not a segment currently being timed for this socket then the [[SYN]] segment will be
   timed with [[t_rttseg']] set to the current time and the initial sequence number for the
   connection.

   The socket's control block will be updated:

   \begin{itemize}

   \item the retransmit and connection establishment timers will be started;

   \item the [[snd_una]] field will be set to the initial sequence number;

   \item the [[snd_max]] and [[snd_nxt]] fields will be set to the initial sequence number plus one;

   \item the [[iss]] field will be set to the initial sequence number;

   \item the [[rcv_wnd]] field will be set to the opening receive window for the connection;

   \item the [[rcv_adv]] field will be set to [[cb.rcv_nxt + rcv_wnd]];

   \item the [[tf_rxwin0sent]] field will be set to [[T]] if a zero length receive window was set or
   [[F]] otherwise;

   \item the [[request_r_scale]] field will record if window scaling was requested and, if so, the
   scale requested;

   \item the [[t_maxseg]] will be set to the maximum segment size for the connection, whether or not
   it is transmitted in the [[SYN]] segment;

   \item the [[t_advmss]] field will be set to [[SOME v]] if the MSS [[v]] was sent with the [[SYN]]
   or [[NONE]] otherwise;

   \item the [[tf_req_tstmp]] field will be set to [[T]] if time-stamping was requested, or [[F]] otherwise;

   \item the [[last_ack_sent]] field will be set to [[0]];

   \item and if the [[SYN]] segment will be timed then the [[t_rttseg]] field will be updated to
   record the time and sequence number of the segment.

   \end{itemize}

   The new control block is [[cb']].

   The [[SYN]] segment [[seg]] shall be placed on the host's outqueue if possible. If there is a
   buffer allocation failure during this then the segment cannot be placed on the host's outqueue:
   [[outsegs' = []]] and [[es' = ENOBUFS]]. If there is no route from an interface specified by the
   local IP address [[i1]] to the peer IP address [[i2]] then the segment cannot be placed on the
   host's outqueue: [[outsegs'=[]]] and [[es']] will be the routing error. If the segment would
   cause the a loopback packet to appear on the wire (something prohibited by RFC 1122), then the
   segment cannot be placed on the host's outqueue; additionally on FreeBSD the [[es'=SOME
   EADDRNOTAVAIL]], on Linux [[es'=SOME EINVAL]], and on WinXP there is no error: the segment is
   silently dropped. All of the above failures result in the socket's control block being reset to
   [[cb]], the control block when the [[connect()]] call was made.

   Otherwise the segment can be placed on the host's outqueue, [[outsegs'=[(seg,queued)]]], using
   {@link [[enqueue_oq_list_qinfo]]} to create new outqueue [[oq']]. If this now fails due to a
   buffer allocation failure, [[queued = F]], then [[es'=ENOBUFS]], [[oq'=h.oq]], and the socket's
   control block is updated to set the [[snd_nxt]] field to the initial sequence number, the
   [[rcv_adv]] and [[last_ack_sent]] fields to [[0]], the [[tt_delack]] option to [[NONE]], and to
   stop the retransmit timer. If the segment is successfully enqueued on the host's outqueue then
   [[es'=NONE]] to create new outqueue [[oq']].

   If the call is made with non-blocking semantics, the [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag of the file description
   for the socket is set, and the socket does not have a pending error then the call will fail with
   either the error [[es']] resulting from a failed attempt to enqueue the [[SYN]] segment [[seg]];
   or an [[EINPROGRESS]] error on FreeBSD and Linux; or an [[EAGAIN]] error on WinXP. The
   [[EINPROGRESS]] and [[EAGAIN]] errors mean that connection establishment is proceeding
   asynchronously and [[connect()]] should be called again to see the result. A
   [[Lh_call(tid,connect(fd,i2,SOME p2))]] transition will be made, leaving the thread state
   [[Ret (FAIL err)]]. If the call failed without enqueueing a [[SYN]] segment then the socket will
   be in state [[CLOSED]] with address quad [[(SOME i1',SOME p1',NONE,NONE)]]; otherwise it will be
   in state [[SYN_SENT]] with address quad [[(SOME i1',SOME p1',SOME i2,SOME p2)]]. In either case
   the pending error will be cleared.

   If the call is made with blocking semantics then it shall block, entering state
   [[Connect2(sid)]]. A [[Lh_call(tid,connect(fd,i2,SOME p2))]] transition will be made leaving the
   thread state [[Connect2(sid)]]. The socket will be in state [[SYN_SENT]] with address quad
   [[(SOME i1',SOME p1',SOME i2,SOME p2)]] and pending error set to [[es']].

   In either case the host's out-queue will be [[oq']] and its list of bound sockets will be
   [[bound]], which shall have [[sid]] appended to its head if the socket was autobound to an
   ephemeral port.

   @description

   Thread [[tid]] is blocked in the [[Connect2(sid)]] state where [[sid]] identifies a TCP socket
   [[sock]] that is in the [[CLOSED]] state: connection establishment has failed, leaving the socket
   in a pending error state [[SOME e]]. Usually this occurs when there is no listening TCP socket at

   establishment timer expired, giving an error of [[ETIMEDOUT]]. The call now returns, failing with

   A [[Lh_tau]] transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret (FAIL e)]].

   @variation FreeBSD

   When connection establishment failed, the [[bsd_cantconnect]] flag in the control block would
   have been set, the socket's [[cantsndmore]] and [[cantrcvmore]] flags would have been set and its
   local address binding would have been removed. This renders the sockets useless: call to
   [[bind()]], [[connect()]], and [[listen()]] will all fail.

   @internal

   This rule was previously used to return [[ECONNREFUSED]] or [[ECONNRESET]] only, however this did
   not take into account failure through connection establishment timeout ([[timer_tt_conn_est_1]] closes
   the socket asynchronously). We now rely on the asynchronous socket closure to set the socket's error
   field correctly, so that this rule may now apply generally to any error that caused the socket to
   become [[CLOSED]] during a [[connect()]] call.

   OLD DESCRIPTION:

   Thread [[tid]] is blocked in the [[Connect2(sid)]] state where [[sid]] identifies a TCP socket
   [[sock]] that is in the [[CLOSED]] state: connection establishment has failed, receiving a
   [[RST]] segment from its peer during connection establishment: usually this occurs when there is
   not a listening TCP socket at the peer address. The call now returns, failing with error [[e]]
   where [[e]] which is either [[ECONNREFUSED]] or [[ECONNRESET]].

   A [[Lh_tau]] transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret (FAIL e)]].
   ===

   When a connection establishment attempt fails (signalled by the state returning to [[CLOSED]]),
   the blocked [[connect()]] returns failure.

   POSIX: we consider particularly the "If the initiating socket is connection-mode" paragraph.

   POSIX implies we must do the autobind anyway.

   OLD COMMENT: Not clear whether we should really return to closed, thus allowing another
   [[connect()]]; I assume it does.  Anyway, does it leave [[SOME i1]] there?  CHECK!

   OLD COMMENT: **POSIX: says, in the *INFORMATIVE* section *APPLICATION USAGE*, that the state of
   the socket is unspecified if connect() fails.  Perhaps we should model this accurately.

   Is it vaguely possible that [[es]] at some point becomes [[SOME ECONNREFUSED]]?

   Not sure if [[ECONNRESET]] belongs here or not; original intention was [[ECONNREFUSED]], but it
   looks to me like [[ECONNRESET]] should also be allowed.  Is this the case?  How are the two
   distinguished?

   Thread [[tid]] is blocked in the [[Connect2(sid)]] state waiting for a connection to be
   established. [[sid]] identifies a TCP socket [[sock]] that has not been shutdown for reading or
   writing, and has binding quad [[(SOME i1,ps1,SOME i2,SOME p2)]] and pending error [[err]]. The
   socket is in state [[SYN_SENT]], is not listening, has empty send and receive queues, and no
   urgent marks set. The call fails, returning the pending error.

   A [[Lh_tau]] transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret (FAIL err)]]. The socket is
   left in state [[CLOSED]] with its peer address not set, its pending error cleared, and its control
   block reset to the initial control block, [[initial_cb]].

   @variation FreeBSD

   If the pending error is [[EADDRNOTAVAIL]] then the error is cleared and returned but the rest of
   the socket stays the same: it is in state [[SYN_SENT]] so the [[SYN]] will be retransmitted until
   it times out.

   If the pending error is not [[EADDRNOTAVAIL]] then the socket is reset as above except that the
   the socket's local ip and port are cleared

   @variation WinXP

   If the error is [[EINVAL]] then this rule does not apply.

   @internal

   If the socket has a pending error then return it, closing the connection. This occurs on an
   output failure (e.g. attempting to connect to a remote host if we're bound to a local IP address)

   TODO: it is unclear how much cleaning up of the socket's state occurs after a connect
   failure. The BSD code suggests that the control block is left in an untidy state. To be
   investigated.

   If [[tcp_sock.st IN {CLOSED; TIME_WAIT}]] then we are allowed to call connect(), so this rule

   If [[tcp_sock.st IN {SYN_SENT; SYN_RECEIVED}]] return error [[EALREADY]] if socket is in
   non-blocking mode or the platform is WinXP. If we are already connecting, new connect requests
   are treated as errors.  NOTE: It is possible that the socket's file flags could be changed to
   blocking mode before this call to connect. BSD and WinXP always get it right and fail if there is a
   pending request. Linux is broken: see rule [[connect_5d]].

   From thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[connect(fd,i2,SOME p2)]] call is
   made. [[fd]] refers to a socket identified by [[sid]] which does not have a local IP address
   set. The {@link [[test_outroute_ip]]} function is used to check if there is a route from the host
   to [[i2]]. There is no route so the call will fail with a routing error [[err]]. If there is no
   interface with a route to the host then on Linux the call fails with [[ENETUNREACH]] and on
   FreeBSD and WinXP it fails with [[EHOSTUNREACH]]. If there are interfaces with a route to the
   host but none of these are up then the call fails with [[ENETDOWN]].

   A [[Lh_call(tid,connect(fd,i2,SOME p2))]] transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret
   (FAIL err)]], where [[err]] is one of the above errors.

   @variation FreeBSD

   This rule does not apply to UDP sockets on FreeBSD. Additionally, if the socket is not bound to a
   local port then it will be autobound to one and [[sid]] will be appended to the head of the
   host's list of bound sockets, [[bound]]. The socket's local IP address may be set to [[SOME i1]]
   even though there is no route from [[i1]] to [[i2]].

   @internal

   If we cannot route to the destination address, and there's not already a source address specified
   in the socket, we give the appropriate error.

@section [[disconnect]] ALL [[disconnect()]]
  \[ <[disconnect: fd -> unit]> \]

   A call to [[disconnect(fd)]], where [[fd]] is a file descriptor referring to a socket, removes
   the peer address for a UDP socket. If a UDP socket has peer address set to [[(SOME i2, SOME p2)]]
   then it can only receive datagrams with source address [[(i2,p2)]]. Calling [[disconnect()]] on
   the socket resets its peer address to [[(NONE,NONE)]], and so it will be able to receive
   datagrams with any source address.

   It does not make sense to disconnect a TCP socket in this way.  Most supported architectures
   simply disallow [[disconnect]] on such a socket; however, Linux implements it as an abortive
   close (see {@link [[close_3]]}).

 @errors

   A call to [[disconnect()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding
   exception is raised:

   @error [[EADDRNOTAVAIL]] There are no ephemeral ports left for autobinding to.

   @error [[EAFNOSUPPORT]] The address family |AF_UNSPEC| is not supported. This can be the
   result for a successful [[disconnect()]] for a UDP socket.

   @error [[EAGAIN]] There are no ephemeral ports left for autobinding to.

  [[disconnect()]] is a Posix [[connect()]] call with the address family set to
  |AF_UNSPEC|.

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:   & |int connect(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address,|\\
             & |            socklen_t address_len);| \\
    FreeBSD: & |int connect(int s, const struct sockaddr *name, |\\
             & |            socklen_t namelen);| \\
    Linux:   & |int connect(int  sockfd,  const  struct sockaddr *serv_addr,|\\
               |            socklen_t addrlen);| \\
    WinXP:   & |int connect(SOCKET s, const struct sockaddr* name,| \\
             & |            int namelen);|\\
  \end{tabular}

  In the Posix interface:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item |socket| is a file descriptor referring to a socket. This corresponds to the [[fd]]
   argument of the model [[disconnect()]].

  \item |address| is a pointer to a location of size |address_len| containing a
   |sockaddr| structure which specifies the address to connect to. For a [[disconnect()]]
   call, the |sin_family| field of the |sockaddr| family must be set to
   |AF_UNSPEC|; other fields can be set to anything.

  \item the returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
   indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is
   indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error
   code available through a call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

   \end{itemize}

  The Linux man-page states: "Unconnecting a socket by calling connect with a AF\_UNSPEC address is
  not yet implemented." As a result, a [[disconnect()]] call always returns successfully on Linux.

  The WinXP documentation states: "The default destination can be changed by simply calling
  |connect| again, even if the socket is already connected. Any datagrams queued for receipt
  are discarded if |name| is different from the previous |connect|." This implies
  that calling [[disconnect()]] will result in all datagrams on the socket's receive queue; however,
  this is not the case: no datagrams are discarded.

      |F_GETFL| for the model [[getfileflags()]]. On WinXP, |cmd| is set to
      |FIONBIO| to get the [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag; there is no [[O_ASYNC]] flag on WinXP.

  [[getifaddrs()]] is two calls to Posix |ioctl()|: one with the |SIOCGIFCONF|
  request and one with the |SIOCGIFNETMASK| request. On FreeBSD there is a specific
  |getifaddrs()| call. On WinXP the [[getifaddrs()]] call does not exist.

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:   & |int ioctl(int fildes, int request, ... /* arg */);| \\
    FreeBSD: & |int getifaddrs(struct ifaddrs **ifap);| \\
    Linux:   & |int ioctl(int d, int request, ...);|
  \end{tabular}

  In the Posix interface:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |fildes| is a file descriptor. There is no corresponding argument in the model
     [[getifaddrs()]].

    \item |request| is the operation to perform on the file. When |request| is
     |SIOCGIFCONF| the list of all interfaces is returned; when it is |SIOCNETMASK|
     the subnet mask is returned for an interface.

    \item The function takes a variable number of arguments. When |request| is
     |SIOCGIFCONF| there is a third argument: a pointer to a location to store a linked-list
     of the interfaces; when it is |SIOCGIFNETMASK| it is a pointer to a structure
     containing the interface and it is filled in with the subnet mask for that interface.

    \item The returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
     indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.

  \end{itemize}

  To construct the return value of type [[(ifid * ip * ip list * netmask) list]], the interface name
  and the IP addresses associated with it are obtained from the call to |ioctl()| using
  |SIOCGIFCONF|, and then the subnet mask for each interface is obtained from a call to
  |ioctl()| using |SIOCGIFNETMASK|.

  On FreeBSD the |ifap| argument to |getifaddrs()| is a pointer to a location to store
  a linked list of the interface information in, corresponding to the return type of the model
  [[getifaddrs()]].

@modeldetails

  Any of the errors possible when making an |ioctl()| call are possible: [[EIO]], [[ENOTTY]],
  [[ENXIO]], and [[ENODEV]]. None of these are modelled.

  Note that the Posix interface admits the possibility that the interfaces will change between the
  two calls, whereas in the model interface the [[getifaddrs()]] call is atomic.

    \item In Posix, [[EINVAL]] can be returned if the socket has been shutdown; none of the

    \item |socket| is the file descriptor of the socket on which to get the flag,
     corresponding to the [[fd]] argument of the model [[getsockbopt()]].

    \item |level| is the protocol level at which the flag resides: |SOL_SOCKET| for
     the socket level options, and |option_name| is the flag to be retrieved. These two
     correspond to the [[flag]] argument to the model [[getsockbopt()]] where the possible values of
     |option_name| are limited to: [[SO_BSDCOMPAT]], [[SO_DONTROUTE]], [[SO_KEEPALIVE]],
     [[SO_OOBINLINE]], and [[SO_REUSEADDR]].

    \item |option_value| is a pointer to a location of size |option_len| to store

     of the model [[getsockbopt()]].

    \item the returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
     indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is
     indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |EFAULT| signifies the pointer passed as |option_value| was
     inaccessible. On WinXP, the error |WSAEFAULT| may also signify that the
     |optlen| parameter was too small.

    \item |EINVAL| signifies the |option_name| was invalid at the specified socket
     |level|. In the model, typing prevents an invalid flag from being specified in a call
     to [[getsockbopt()]].

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking

     interface to |getsockname()| that is excluded by the clean interface used in the model
     [[getsockname()]].

    \item in Posix, [[EINVAL]] can be returned if the socket has been shutdown. None of the
    implementations return [[EINVAL]] in this case.

    \item in Posix, [[EOPNOTSUPP]] is returned if the [[getsockname()]] operation is not supported
     by the protocol. Both UDP and TCP support this operation.

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking

    POSIX: if socket is unbound, the return value is \emph{unspecified}.  We give it as

    POSIX claims [[EINVAL]] is possible "if the socket has been shut down".  We have not modelled

     \item In Posix, [[EACCES]] may be returned if the calling process does not have the appropriate
      privileges. This is not modelled here.

     \item In Posix, [[EDESTADDRREQ]] shall be returned if the socket is not bound to a local
      address and the protocol does not support listening on an unbound socket. WinXP returns an
      [[EINVAL]] error in this case; FreeBSD and Linux autobind the socket if [[listen()]] is called
      on an unbound socket.

     \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking

  @description

   From thread [[tid]], which is currently in the [[Run]] state, a [[listen(fd,n)]] call is
   made. [[fd]] is a file descriptor referring to a TCP socket identified by [[sid]] which is not
   shutdown for writing, is in the [[CLOSED]] state, has an empty send and receive queue, and does
   not have its send or receive urgent pointers set. The host's list of listening sockets is
   [[listen0]]. Either the socket is bound to a local port [[p1]], or it can be autobound to a local
   port [[p1]].

   The call succeeds: a [[Lh_call(tid,listen(fd,n))]] transition is made, leaving the thread in
   state [[Ret (OK())]]. The socket is put in the [[LISTEN]] state, with an empty listen queue,
   [[lis]], with [[n]] as its backlog. [[sid]] is added to the host's list of listening sockets,
   [[listen := sid::listen0]], and if autobinding occurred, it is also added to the host's list of
   bound sockets, [[h.bound]], to create a new list [[bound]].

   @variation FreeBSD

   The [[bsd_cantconnect]] flag in the control block must not be set to [[T]] (from an earlier
   connection establishment attempt).

   @variation WinXP

   As above, except that the socket must be bound to a local port [[p1]]. If it is not bound then
   autobinding will not occur: the call will fail with an [[EINVAL]] error. See also {@link [[listen_2]]}.

   @internal

   Places the specified socket on [[listen]], the queue of listening sockets, and moves it into
   state [[LISTEN]].  The maximum permitted queue length depends on this parameter, although not
   necessarily directly (see [[accept_incoming_q0]], [[accept_incoming_q]], [[drop_from_q0]]).

   Here we put sockets on the listen queue in order of [[listen()]], rather than in order of
   [[bind()]].  We're not sure which is correct.

   On Windows, it is illegal not to specify the bound port; on other architectures, we autobind one
   if required.

   On BSD, listen() may be called on a socket that is shutdown for reading (but not writing), whereas
   other architectures require cantrcvmore = F.

   On most OSs, the socket must be [[CLOSED]]; BSD incorrectly omits this check. If a connected socket
   enters the [[LISTEN]] state, then it retains its full quad, thus only enabling it to accept
   connections from the same remote IP/port. A connect may occur in the usual way if this is the
   case. Despite having a full quad, and the SS_ISCONNECTED flag set, the socket cannot send any
   data, since BSD checks its actual state (and tries unsuccessfully to call connect()). The other
   behaviour is as expected for a listening socket, except that getpeername() will return successfully.

   @internal

   If [[listen()]] is called on a socket in the [[LISTEN]] state the maximum queue length parameter
   is updated. This does not necessarily alter the maximum queue length directly (see
   [[accept_incoming_q0]], [[accept_incoming_q]], [[drop_from_q0]]).

   TODO: we are unsure what the actual behaviour is of calling [[listen()]] on a listening socket on
   most architectures. We know the call succeeds but it is currently unclear whether the queue
   length parameter is updated or not. Trace checking should help resolve this.

   HISTORY: Is it legal to call [[listen()]] multiple times?  <3E15D94A.D7B7507C@webmaster.com> on
   comp.protocols.tcp-ip suggests that this can be used to alter the size of the backlog queue.  Our

@section [[pselect]] ALL [[pselect()]]
  \[ <[pselect: (fd list * fd list * fd list * (int * int) option * signal list option) -> (fd list * (fd list * fd list))]> \]

  A call to [[pselect(readfds,writefds,exceptfds,timeout,sigmask)]] waits for one of the file
  descriptors in [[readfds]] to be ready for reading, [[writefds]] to be ready for writing,
  [[exceptfds]] to have a pending error, or for [[timeout]] to expire.

  The [[readfds]] argument is a set of file descriptors to be checked for being ready to read. Broadly, a
  file descriptor [[fd]] is ready for reading if a [[recv(fd,_,_)]] call on the socket would not
  block, i.e.~if there is data present or a pending error.

  The [[writefds]] argument is a set of file descriptors to be checked for being ready to write. Broadly, a
  file descriptor [[fd]] is ready for writing if a [[send(fd,_,_,_)]] call would not block.

  The [[exceptfds]] argument is a set of file descriptors to be checked for exception conditions
  pending. A file descriptor [[fd]] has an exception condition pending if there exists out-of-band
  data for the socket it refers to or the socket is still at the out-of-band mark.

  The [[timeout]] argument specifies how long the [[pselect()]] call should block waiting for a file
  descriptor to be ready. If [[timeout=NONE]] then the call should block until one of the file
  descriptors in the [[readfds]], [[writefds]], or [[exceptfds]] becomes ready. If
  [[timeout=SOME(s,ns)]] then the call should block for at most [[s]] seconds and [[ns]]
  nanoseconds. However, system activity can lengthen the timeout interval by an indeterminate
  amount.

  The [[sigmask]] argument is used to set the signal mask, the set of signals to be blocked. In the
  implementations, if [[sigmask=SOME(siglist)]] then [[pselect()]] first replaces the current signal
  mask by [[siglist]] before proceeding with the call, and then restores the original signal mask
  upon return.  This specification does not model the dynamic behaviour of signals, however, and so
  we specify the behaviour of [[pselect()]] only for an empty signal mask.

  A return value of [[(readfds',(writefds',exceptfds'))]] from a [[pselect()]] call signifies that:
  the file descriptors in [[readfds']] are ready for reading; the file descriptors in [[writefds']]
  are reading for writing; and the file descriptors in [[exceptfds']] have exceptional conditions
  pending.

  If a [[pselect([],[],[],Some(s,ns),sigmask)]] call is made then the call will block for [[s]]
  seconds and [[ns]] nano-seconds or until a signal occurs.

  To perform a poll, a [[pselect(readfds,writefds,exceptfds,Some(0,0),sigmask)]] call should be
  made.

@errors

  A call to [[pselect()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception
  is raised:

  @error [[EBADF]] One or more of the file descriptors in a set is not a valid file descriptor.

  In the Posix interface:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |nfds| specifies the range of file descriptors to be tested. The first
     |nfds| file descriptors shall be checked in each set. This is not necessary in the
     model [[pselect()]] as the file descriptor sets are implemented as a [[list]] rather than the
     integer arrays in Posix |pselect()|.

    \item |readfds| on input specifies the file descriptors to be checked for being ready to
     read, corresponding to the [[readfds]] argument of the model [[pselect()]]. On output
     |readfds| indicates which of the file descriptors specified on input are ready to read,
     corresponding to the first [[fd list]] in the return type of the model [[pselect()]]. An
     |fd_set| is an integer array, where each bit of each integer corresponds to a file
     descriptor. If that bit is set then that file descriptor should be
     checked. |FD_CLR()|, |FD_ISSET()|, |FD_SET()|, and
     |FD_ZERO()| are provided to set bits in an |fd_set|.

    \item |writefds| on input specifies the file descriptors to be checked for being ready
     to write, corresponding to the [[writefds]] argument of the model [[pselect()]]. On output
     |writefds| indicates which of the file descriptors specified on input are ready to
     write, corresponding to the second [[fd list]] in the return type of the model [[pselect()]].

    \item |errorfds| on input specifies the file descriptors to be checked for pending error
     conditions, corresponding to the [[exceptfds]] argument of the model [[pselect()]]. On output
     |exceptfds| indicated which of the file descriptors specified on input have pending
     error conditions, corresponding to the third [[fd list]] in the return type of the model
     [[pselect()]].

    \item |timeout| specifies how long the |pselect()| call shall block before
     timing out, corresponding to the [[timeout]] argument of the model [[pselect()]]. If the
     |timeout| parameter is a null pointer this corresponds to [[timeout=NONE]]; if the
     |timeout| parameter is not a null pointer, then its two fields,
     |timeout.tv_sec| (the number of seconds) and |timeout.tv_nsec| (the number of
     nano-seconds), correspond to [[timeout=SOME(s,ns)]] where [[s]] is the number of seconds, and
     [[ns]] is the number of nano-seconds.

    \item |sigmask| is the signal-mask to be used when examining the file descriptors,
     corresponding to the [[sigmask]] argument of the model [[pselect()]]. If |sigmask| is a
     null pointer then [[sigmask = NONE]] in the model; if |sigmask| is not a null pointer
     then [[sigmask = SOME sigs]] in the model where [[sigs]] is the signal-mask to use.

    \item if the call is successful then the returned |int| is the number of bits set in the
     three |fd_set| arguments: the total number of file descriptors ready for reading,
     writing, or having exceptional conditions pending. Otherwise, the returned |int| is
     |-1| to indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On
     WinXP an error is indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|,
     with the actual error code available through a call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  The Linux interface is similar. On FreeBSD and WinXP there is no |pselect()| call, only a
  |select()| call which is the same as the interface described above, except without the
  |sigmask| argument. The |select()| call corresponds to calling the model
  [[pselect()]] with [[sigmask=NONE]]. Additionally, the |timeout| argument is a pointer to
  a |timeval| structure which has two members |tv_sec| and |tv_usec|,
  specifying the seconds and micro-seconds to block for, rather than seconds and nano-seconds.

  The FreeBSD man page for |select()| warns of the following bug: "Version 2 of the Single
  UNIX Specification ("SUSv2") allows systems to modify the original timeout in place.  Thus, it is
  unwise to assume that the timeout value will be unmodified by the select() call."

@modeldetails

  If the [[pselect()]] call blocks then the thread enters state [[PSelect2(readfds,writefds,exceptfds)]] where:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item [[readfds : fd list]] is the list of file descriptors to be checked for being ready to read.

  \item [[writefds : fd list]] is the list of file descriptors to be checked for being ready to
  write.

  \item [[exceptfds : fd list]] is the list of file descriptors to be checked for pending
  exceptional conditions.

  \end{itemize}

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking
     Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback
     function". This is not modelled here.

  \end{itemize}

    From thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a
    [[pselect(readfds,writefds,exceptfds,timeout,sigmask)]] call is made. The time-out is
    well-formed and no signal mask was set: [[sigmask=NONE]]. All of the file descriptors in the
    sets [[readfds]], [[writefds]], and [[exceptfds]] are greater than the maximum allowed file
    descriptor in a set for the architecure, [[FD_SETSIZE]], and all of them are valid file
    descriptors: they are in the host's finite map of file descriptors, [[h.fds]].

    The call returns, without blocking, three sets: [[readfds'']], [[writefds'']], and
    [[exceptfds'']]. [[readfds'']] is the set of valid file descriptors in [[readfds]] that are
    ready for reading: a blocking [[recv(fd,_,_)]] call would not block; see {@link [[soreadable]]}
    for details. [[writefds'']] is the set of valid file descriptors in [[writefds]] that are ready
    for writing: a blocking [[send(fd,_,_)]] call would not block; see {@link [[sowriteable]]} for
    details. [[exceptfds'']] is the set of valid file descriptors in [[exceptfds]] that have pending
    exceptional conditions; see {@link [[soexceptional]]} for details.

    One of these three sets must be non-empty or else a zero timeout was specified, [[timeout=SOME(0,0)]]. A
    [[Lh_call(tid,pselect(readfds,writefds,exceptfds,timeout,sigmask))]] transition is made, leaving
    the thread state [[Ret (OK(readfds'',writefds'',exceptfds''))]].

    @variation FreeBSD

    Invalid file descriptors (ones not in the host's finite map of file descriptors, [[h.fds]]) may
    be present in the sets [[readfds]], [[writefds]], and [[exceptfds]], and all such file
    descriptors will then be included in the return sets [[readfds'']], [[writefds'']], and
    [[exceptfds'']].

    @variation WinXP

    On WinXP [[FD_SETSIZE]] is the maximum number of file descriptors in a set, so none of the sets
    [[readfds]], [[writefds]], and [[exceptfds]] has more than [[FD_SETSIZE]] members. Additionally,
    all three sets may not be empty.

    The time-out need not be well-formed because one or more file descriptors is immediately ready.

    @internal

    The user gives three sets of file descriptors to be observed for readability, writeability, and
    exceptional conditions respectively.  The OS will wait until (at least) one of the fds develops
    the state required, or up until the timeout specified.  While waiting, certain signals are
    ignored (??).  We simply check the validity of all the fds given, set a timer, and then block;
    other rules deal with success and failure.

    The POSIX spec describes this in terms like "returns if a call to send() would not block"; but
    that is of course rather ambiguous... how many bytes?  what flags are set? etc.  So we write
    down here exactly what we mean, and then we will prove some lemmas about the relationship
    between the behaviour of select and the behaviour of send() recv() etc.

    [[sigmask]] unimplemented at present.

    What if someone closes an [[fd]] while we're blocked in select?  (I think the close() should be
    an event noticed by the select()).

    If a file descriptor becomes ready, or the timer reaches zero, we return the sets of file
    descriptors that have the desired conditions.

    In order from UNPv1p153.  We should check for sanity against send() and recv().  Amusingly, UNP
    says the "purpose" of the lowat marks is to control when select() returns.

    We believe this implements the required semantics of connect() (by POSIX), that when a connect()
    succeeds, the socket becomes writeable for the purposes of select().  (simply because the socket
    *is* then writeable).

    Note that the available space on the send queue may be negative.

    have not done any semantics for non-socket fds yet.

    URGENT

    From FreeBSD man page: "Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification ("SUSv2") allows systems to
    modify the original timeout in place.  Thus, it is unwise to assume that the timeout value will
    be unmodified by the select() call." This does happen on FreeBSD.

  [[fd]] is a file descriptor referring to a TCP socket to read data from,

  \item [[MSG_PEEK]]: Read data but do not remove it from the socket's receive queue.

  \item [[MSG_WAITALL]]: Block until all [[n]] bytes of data are available.

  \end{itemize}

  The returned [[string]] is the data read from the socket's receive queue. The [[((ip * port) *
  bool) option]] is always returned as [[NONE]] for a TCP socket.

  In order to receive data, a TCP socket must be connected to a peer; otherwise, the [[recv()]] call
  will fail with an [[ENOTCONN]] error.  If the socket has a pending error then the [[recv()]] call
  will fail with this error even if there is data available.

  If there is no data available and non-blocking behaviour is not enabled (the socket's
  [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is not set and the [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag was not used) then the [[recv()]] call
  will block until data arrives or an error occurs. If non-blocking behaviour is enabled and there is no
  data or error then the call will fail with an [[EAGAIN]] error.

  The [[MSG_OOB]] flag can be set in order to receive out-of-band data; for this,
the socket's [[SO_OOBINLINE]] cannot be set (i.e.~out-of-band data must not be being returned inline).

@errors

  A call to [[recv()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception
  is raised:

  @error [[EAGAIN]] Non-blocking [[recv()]] call made and no data available; or out-of-band data
  requested and none is available.

  @error [[EINVAL]] Out-of-band data requested and [[SO_OOBINLINE]] flag set or the out-of-band
  data has already been read.

  @error [[ENOTCONN]] Socket not connected.

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOTSOCK]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EBADF]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EINTR]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOBUFS]]

@commoncases

  A TCP socket is created and then connected to a peer; a [[recv()]] call is made to receive data
  from that peer: [[socket_1]]; [[return_1]]; [[connect_1]]; [[return_1]]; [[recv_1]]; $\dots $

@api

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:  &  |ssize_t recv(int socket, void *buffer, size_t length, int flags); | \\
    FreeBSD:&  |ssize_t recv(int s, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);| \\
    Linux:  &  |int recv(int s, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);| \\
    WinXP:  &  |int recv(SOCKET s, char* buf, int len, int flags);| \\
  \end{tabular}\\

  In the Posix interface:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |socket| is the file descriptor of the socket to receive from, corresponding to
     the [[fd]] argument of the model [[recv()]].

    \item |buffer| is a pointer to a buffer to place the received data in, which upon return
     contains the data received on the socket. This corresponds to the [[string]] return value of
     the model [[recv()]].

    \item |length| is the amount of data to be read from the socket, corresponding to the [[int]]
     argument of the model [[recv()]]; it should be at most the length of |buffer|.

    \item |flags| is a disjunction of the message flags that are set for the call, corresponding to
     the [[msgbflag]] [[list]] argument of the model [[recv()]].

    \item the returned |ssize_t| is either non-negative, in which case it is the the amount
     of data that was received by the socket, or it is |-1| to indicate an error, in which
     case the error code is in |errno|. On WinXP an error is indicated by a return value of
     |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error code available through a
     call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  The FreeBSD, Linux and WinXP interfaces are similar modulo argument renaming, except where
  noted above.

  There are other functions used to receive data on a socket. |recvfrom()| is similar to
  |recv()| except it returns the source address of the data; this is used for UDP but is not
  necessary for TCP as the source address will always be the peer the socket has connected
  to. |recvmsg()|, another input function, is a more general form of |recv()|.


@modeldetails

  If the call blocks then the thread enters state [[Recv2(sid,n,opts)]] where:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item [[sid : sid]] is the identifier of the socket that the [[recv()]] call was made on,

    \item [[n : num]] is the number of bytes to be read, and

    \item [[opts : msgbflag list]] is the list of message flags.

  \end{itemize}

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

   \item On FreeBSD, Linux, and WinXP, [[EFAULT]] can be returned if the |buffer|
    parameter points to memory not in a valid part of the process address space. This is an artefact
    of the C interface to |ioctl()| that is excluded by the clean interface used in the
    model [[recv()]].

    \item In Posix, |EIO| may be returned to indicated that an I/O error occurred while
    reading from or writing to the file system; this is not modelled here.

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking
     Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback
     function". This is not modelled here.

  \end{itemize}

  The following Linux message flags are not modelled: |MSG_NOSIGNAL|, |MSG_TRUNC|, and
  |MSG_ERRQUEUE|.

    @description

    From thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[recv(fd,n0,opts0)]] call is made where
    out-of-band data is not requested. [[fd]] refers to a synchronised TCP socket [[sid]] with
    binding quad [[(SOME i1,SOME p1,SOME i2,SOME p2)]] and no pending error. Alternatively the
    socket is uninitialised and in state [[CLOSED]].

    The call can return immediately because either: (1) there are at least [[n]] bytes of data in
    the socket's receive queue (the [[have_all_data]] case above); (2) the length of the socket's
    receive queue is greater than or equal to the minimum number of bytes for socket [[recv()]]
    operations, [[sf.n(SO_RCVLOWAT)]], and the call does not have to return all [[n]] bytes of data;
    either because (i) the [[MSG_WAITALL]] flag is not set in [[opts0]], (ii) the number of bytes requested
    is greater than the number of bytes in the socket's receive queue, or (iii) on non-FreeBSD
    architectures the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag is set in [[opts0]] (the [[have_enough_data /\
    partial_data_ok]] case above); (3) there is urgent data available in the socket's receive queue
    (the [[urgent_data_ahead]] case above); or (4) the socket has been shutdown for reading.

    The call succeeds, returning a string, [[IMPLODE str]], which is either: (5) the smaller of the first
    [[n]] bytes of the socket's receive queue or its entire receive queue, if the urgent pointer is
    not set or the socket is at the urgent mark; or (6) the smaller of the first [[n]] bytes of the
    the socket's receive queue, the data in its receive queue up to the urgent mark, and its entire
    receive queue, if the urgent mark is set and the socket is not at the urgent mark.

    A [[Lh_call(tid,recv(fd,n0,opts0))]] transition is made leaving the thread state [[Ret
    (OK(IMPLODE str,NONE))]]. If the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag was set in [[opts0]] then the socket's
    receive queue remains unchanged; otherwise, the data [[str]] is removed from the head of the
    socket's receive queue, [[rcvq]], to leave the socket with new receive queue [[rcvq']]. If the
    receive urgent pointer was not set or was set to [[SOME 0]] then it will be set to [[NONE]]; if it
    was set to [[SOME om]] and  [[om]] is less than the length of the returned string then it will be
    set to [[SOME 0]] (because the returned string was the data in the receive queue up to the
    urgent mark); otherwise it will be set to [[SOME(om-LENGTH str)]].

    @modeldetails

    The amount of data requested, [[n0]], is clipped to a natural number from an integer, using
    [[clip_int_to_num]]. POSIX specifies an unsigned type for [[n0]] and this is one possible model
    thereof.

    The [[opts0]] argument to [[recv()]] is of type [[msgbflag list]], but it is converted to a set,
    [[opts]], using [[LIST_TO_SET]].

    The data itself is represented as a [[byte list]] in the datagram but is returned a [[string]]:
    the [[IMPLODE]] function is used to do the conversion.

    @internal

    Attempt to receive data from the socket receive queue.  If the caller wants ordinary data and
    is not peeking, and either there is pending data on the receive queue or the caller wants 0 bytes
    (and if [[MSG_WAITALL]] is set, *all* desired bytes are present), then return the appropriate
    prefix of the receive queue, and leave the remainder on the queue.

    Note that we only need to check for nonblocking (in socket or flags) if we might block, which we
    cannot here.

    We *think* from POSIX that [[MSG_PEEK]] means that the [[MSG_WAITALL]] behaviour should not
    apply.  It's not clear, though; a straightforward reading would make this semantics a MAY not a
    MUST. In fact, under BSD, [[MSG_PEEK]] does not affect [[MSG_WAITALL]] behaviour, and the call
    still requires n bytes of data to be returned.

    We also think that if [[MSG_PEEK]] is set (and [[MSG_WAITALL]] is not set), that the call will not
    return until at least [[SO_RCVLOWAT]] bytes are available.

    The [[clip_int_to_num]] represents one possible implementation.  POSIX specifies an unsigned
    type for [[n0]], so negative values cannot arise.

    Does the [[rcvurp]] evaporate whenever we read up to the mark?  If so, the test should be [[om
    <= LENGTH str]].  If not, it should be [[<]].  (But note that [[om]] is never less than [[LENGTH
    str]], because we never read *past* the mark, only up to it).

    We should allow this to be interrupted *in the middle* by an interrupt, in which case we return
    the number of bytes transferred.  But this does it atomically, so there's no middle!  Oops!

    CHANGE TO MEM AND NOTMEM and do clever typesetting for them.

    TODO: for this and other recv rules, should deliver in any [[st >= ESTABLISHED]], not just in
    [[ESTABLISHED]].  Note that even if data arrives before [[ESTABLISHED]], it should not be
    delivered until then.

    From thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[recv(fd,n0,opts0)]] call is made where
    out-of-band data is not requested. [[fd]] refers to a TCP socket [[sid]] in state
    [[ESTABLISHED]], [[SYN_SENT]], [[SYN_RECEIVED]], [[FIN_WAIT_1]], or [[FIN_WAIT_2]], with binding
    quad [[(SOME i1,SOME p1,SOME i2,SOME p2)]] and no pending error. The call is blocking: the
    [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag is not set in [[opts0]] and the socket's [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is not set.

    The call cannot return immediately because: (1) there are less than [[n]] bytes of data in the
    socket's receive queue; (2) there are less than [[sf.n(SO_RVCLOWAT)]] (the minimum number of
    bytes for socket [[recv()]] operations) bytes of data in the socket's receive queue or the call
    must return all [[n]] bytes of data: (i) the [[MSG_WAITALL]] flag is set in [[opts0]], (ii) the
    number of bytes requested is greater than the length of the socket's receive queue, and (iii)
    the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag is not set in [[opts0]]; (3) there is no urgent data ahead in the socket's
    receive queue; and (4) the socket is not shutdown for reading.

    The call blocks in state [[Recv2]] waiting for data; a [[Lh_call(tid,recv(fd,n0,opts0))]]
    transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Recv2(sid,n,opts)]].

    @variation FreeBSD

    In case (iii) above, the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag may be set in [[opts0]].

    @modeldetails

    The amount of data requested, [[n0]], is clipped to a natural number from an integer, using
    [[clip_int_to_num]]. POSIX specifies an unsigned type for [[n0]], whereas the model uses [[int]].

    Attempt to read data from the socket receive queue.  If the receive queue is empty (and the
    caller wants more than 0 bytes), or the caller wants all the bytes and the receive queue does not
    contain them, *and* nonblocking behaviour is not requested, and the caller does not want OOB
    data, then we block until the data arrives.

    We can try to block (and therefore fail to block) in any connecting/connected state, however we
    never try to block after receiving a FIN, since we know we'll never get any more data!

    Worried about [[SO_RCVTIMEO]] here when [[MSG_WAITALL]] is set.  Need to (a) maintain that timer

    Sufficient data is not available on the socket for the call to return: either (1) there is at
    least [[n]] bytes of data in the socket's receive queue (the [[have_all_data]] case above); (2)
    the length of the socket's receive queue is greater than or equal to the minimum number of bytes

    all [[n]] bytes of data (the [[partial_data_ok]] case): either (i) the [[MSG_WAITALL]] flag is
    not set in [[opts]], (ii) the number of bytes requested is greater than the number of bytes in
    the socket's receive queue, or (iii) on non-FreeBSD architectures the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag is set

    available in the socket's receive queue (the [[urgent_data_ahead]] cae above); or (4) the socket
    has been shutdown for reading.

    The data returned, [[str]], is either: (1) the smaller of the first [[n]] bytes of the socket's
    receive queue or its entire receive queue, if the urgent pointer is not set or the socket is at
    the urgent mark; or (2) the smaller of the first [[n]] bytes of the the socket's receive queue,
    the data in its receive queue up to the urgent mark, and its entire receive queue, if the urgent
    mark is set and the socket is not at the urgent mark.

    A [[Lh_tau]] transition is made leaving the thread state [[Ret (OK(IMPLODE str,NONE))]]. If
    the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag was set in [[opts]] then the socket's receive queue remains unchanged;
    otherwise, the data [[str]] is removed from the head of the socket's receive queue, [[rcvq]], to
    leave the socket with new receive queue [[rcvq']]. If the receive urgent pointer was not set or was
    set to [[SOME 0]] then it will be set to [[NONE]]; if it was set to [[SOME om]] and [[om]] is
    less than the length of the returned string then it will be set to [[SOME 0]] (because the
    returned string was the data in the receive queue up to the urgent mark); otherwise it will be
    set to [[SOME(om-LENGTH str)]].

    @modeldetails

    The data itself is represented as a [[byte list]] in the datagram but is returned a [[string]]:
    the [[IMPLODE]] function is used to do the conversion.

    @internal

    If the receive queue is nonempty or we've received a FIN, then we do just the same as
    [[recv_1]], and return from the call.

    Do we really know that the [[fid]] argument of the socket is [[SOME fid]]?  What if the caller
    closes the socket after a blocking [[recv()]]?

    This allows for the case that recv() has been called under BSD with the [[MSG_WAITALL]] option.
    soreceive() (see lines 899-929 in kern/uipc_socket.c) returns ok in the case of its sbwait being
    interrupted by an error iff [[MSG_WAITALL]] is set, causing the recv() to return with the data currently
    in the receive buffer. [[deliver_in_7]] checks to see if an RST is received during an recv(MSG_WAITALL),
    and if so calls a special version of [[tcp_output]] ([[tcp_output_bsd_recv2]]) to close the socket without
    clearing [[rcvq]]. Thus [[recv_3]] is able to access the data currently in the buffer (which is cleared
    in the process of being passed to the user).

    The case of [[MSG_PEEK]] being set is also considered, given that a combination of this and the above
    could cause a closed socket to exist with a non-empty receive queue. We therefore clear [[rcvq]] regardless
    of whether [[MSG_PEEK]] has been set, if the socket is in the [[CLOSED]] state.

    @description

    From thead [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[recv(fd,n0,opts0)]] call is made where
    out-of-band data is not requested. [[fd]] refers to a TCP socket [[sid]] with binding quad
    [[(SOME i1,SOME p1,SOME i2,SOME p2)]] and no pending error, which is in state [[ESTABLISHED]],
    [[SYN_SENT]], [[SYN_RECEIVED]], [[FIN_WAIT_1]], or [[FIN_WAIT_2]]. The [[recv()]] call is
    non-blocking: either the [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag was set in [[opts0]] or the socket's
    [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is set.

    The call would block because: (1) there are less than [[n]] bytes of data in the socket's
    receive queue; (2) there are less than [[sf.n(SO_RVCLOWAT)]] (the minimum number of bytes for
    socket [[recv()]] operations) bytes of data in the socket's receive queue or the call must
    return all [[n]] bytes of data: (i) the [[MSG_WAITALL]] flag is set in [[opts0]], (ii) the
    number of bytes requested is greater than the length of the socket's receive queue, and (iii)
    the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag is not set in [[opts0]]; (3) there is no urgent data ahead in the socket's
    receive queue; (4) the socket is not shutdown for reading; and (5) if the socket's receive queue
    is empty then it has no pending error.

    The call fails with an [[EAGAIN]] error. A [[Lh_call(tid,recv(fd,n0,opts0))]] transition is
    made, leaving the thread state [[Ret (FAIL EAGAIN)]].


    @variation FreeBSD

    In case (iii) above, the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag may be set in [[opts0]].

    @modeldetails

    The amount of data requested, [[n0]], is clipped to a natural number from an integer, using
    [[clip_int_to_num]]. POSIX specifies an unsigned type for [[n0]] and this is one possible model
    thereof.

    The [[opts0]] argument to [[recv()]] is of type [[msgbflag list]], but it is converted to a set,
    [[opts]], using [[LIST_TO_SET]].

    @internal

    If the receive queue is empty (and the caller wants more than 0 bytes), or the caller wants all
    the bytes and the receive queue does not contain them, *and* nonblocking behaviour is requested,
    and the caller does not want OOB data, then we fail with [[EAGAIN]] indicating that we would have
    blocked.

    We can try to block (and therefore fail to block) in any connecting/connected state, however we
    never try to block after receiving a FIN, since we know we'll never get any more data!

    Can we merge this rule with [[recv_2]] while maintaining clarity?

    FIX COMMENTS (first paras) on [[recv_1]] through [[recv_4]].

    MORE STUFF TO DO:

    In both states, we need to deal with pending errors arriving causing an early return.  Need to
    deal with connecction termination.  Need to deal with signals arriving.  (in these cases, we
    cannot necessarily return an error because the kernel may already have copied some bytes to the
    user process).

    ==> After discussion, we think that this does not mean the copy from kernel to user space can be
    interrupted, only that when the thread blocks waiting for enough data ([[WAITALL|RCVLOWAT]]) it can
    be interrupted (by EINTR or signal or pending error).  But we do not know.

    ==> But when that interrupt arrives, we have two possibilities: (i) return the error
    immediately, or (ii) copy as much as we have so far, and allow the error to be returned at the
    next call.  Option (ii) does make sense in at least one case: if the kernel copies data directly
    from the NIC to user space, without going via kernel space.

    ==> We need to determine if this happens significantly in the OSs we care about.  If it does, we
    need to do a substantial rewrite, because for us now the operation is atomic (and so nothing can
    happen during the copy).

    ==> There is an easy case, though: if we're blocked with some stuff in rcvq and an
    interrupt/error arrives, at present we just return that error, but we could simply return the
    contents of rcvq (if nonempty) to the user successfully (and not touch the error flag).

    ==> The worst case is that we can get an interrupt *during* a fast succeed or slow succeed,
    i.e., something that is at present atomic.

    We need to deal with all the error conditions.

    We need to implement the [[SO_RCVTIMEO]] timer.

    We need to do all the protocol-layer stuff.

    says that's wrong - in fact, we do everything; we just do not actually copy the byte.  In
    particular, this means that the OOB byte is lost.

    Note that [[O_NONBLOCK]] or not has no effect on an out-of-band [[recv()]].

    because: (1) there are less than [[n]] bytes of data in the socket's receive queue; (2) there
    are less than [[sf.n(SO_RVCLOWAT)]] (the minimum number of bytes for socket [[recv()]]

    set in [[opts]]; and (3) there is no urgent data ahead in the socket's receive queue.

    The thread returns from the blocked state, returning the pending error. A [[Lh_tau]] transition

    This was a rule in the UDP spec. Comments above question whether it should be here.  TCPv2 p516
    says that if the call has blocked and an error occurs, then that would be returned.

    p515 also says that MSG_PEEK should not clear the socket's error state.

@section [[udp_recv]] UDP [[recv()]]
 \[ <[recv: (fd * int * msgbflag list) -> (string * ((ip * port) * bool) option)]> \]

  A call to [[recv(fd,n,opts)]] returns data from the datagram on the head of a socket's receive
  queue.
   This section describes
  the behaviour for UDP sockets.
  Here the [[fd]] argument is a file descriptor referring to the socket to receive data from,   [[n]] specifies the number of
  bytes of data to read from that socket, and the [[opts]] argument is a list of flags for the [[recv()]] call.  The possible flags are:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item [[MSG_DONTWAIT]]: non-blocking behaviour is requested for this call. This flag only has
     effect on Linux. FreeBSD and WinXP ignore it. See rules [[recv_12]] and [[recv_13]].

    \item [[MSG_PEEK]]: return data from the datagram on the head of the receive queue, without
     removing that datagram from the receive queue.

    \item [[MSG_WAITALL]]: do not return until all [[n]] bytes of data have been read. Linux and
     FreeBSD ignore this flag. WinXP fails with [[EOPNOTSUPP]] as this is not meaningful for UDP
     sockets: the returned data is from only one datagram.

    \item [[MSG_OOB]]: return out-of-band data. This flag is ignored on Linux. On WinXP and FreeBSD
     the call fails with [[EOPNOTSUPP]] as out-of-band data is not meaningful for UDP sockets.

  \end{itemize}

  The returned value of the [[recv()]] call, [[(string * ((ip * port) * bool) option)]], consists of
  the data read from the socket (the [[string]]), the source address of the data (the [[ip *
  port]]), and a flag specifying whether or not all of the datagram's data was read (the
  [[bool]]). The latter two components are wrapped in an [[option]] type (for type compatibility with the TCP [[recv()]]) but are always returned for UDP. The
  flag only has meaning on WinXP and should be ignored on FreeBSD and Linux.

  For a socket to receive data, it must be bound to a local port. On Linux and FreeBSD, if the
  socket is not bound to a local port, then it is autobound to an ephemeral port when the [[recv()]]
  call is made. On WinXP, calling [[recv()]] on a socket that is not bound to a local port is an
  [[EINVAL]] error.

  If a non-blocking [[recv()]] call is made (the socket's [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is set) and there are
  no datagrams on the socket's receive queue, then the call will fail with [[EAGAIN]]. If the call
  is a blocking one and the socket's receive queue is empty then the call will block, returning when
  a datagram arrives or an error occurs.

  If the socket has a pending error then on FreeBSD and Linux, the call will fail with that
  error. On WinXP, errors from ICMP messages are placed on the socket's receive queue, and so the
  error will only be returned when that message is at the head of the receive queue.

@errors

  A call to [[recv()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception is
  raised.

  @error [[EAGAIN]] The call would block and non-blocking behaviour is requested. This is done
   either via the [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag being set in the [[recv()]] flags or the socket's
   [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag being set.

  @error [[EMSGSIZE]] The amount of data requested in the [[recv()]] call on WinXP is less than the
   amount of data in the datagram on the head of the receive queue.

  @error [[EOPNOTSUPP]] Operation not supported: out-of-band data is requested on FreeBSD and WinXP,
   or the [[MSG_WAITALL]] flag is set on a [[recv()]] call on WinXP.

  @error [[ESHUTDOWN]] On WinXP, a [[recv()]] call is made on a socket that has been shutdown for
   reading.

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EBADF]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOTSOCK]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EINTR]]

  \end{tabular}

  In the Posix interface:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |socket| is the file descriptor of the socket to receive from, corresponding to
     the [[fd]] argument of the model [[recv()]].

    \item |buffer| is a pointer to a buffer to place the received data in, which upon return
     contains the data received on the socket. This corresponds to the [[string]] return value of
     the model [[recv()]].


    \item |length| is the amount of data to be read from the socket, corresponding to the [[int]]
     argument of the model [[recv()]]; it should be at most the length of |buffer|.

    \item |flags| is a disjunction of the message flags that are set for the call, corresponding to
     the [[msgbflag]] [[list]] argument of the model [[recv()]].

    \item |address| is a pointer to a |sockaddr| structure of length
     |address_len|, which upon return contains the source address of the data received by
     the socket corresponding to the [[(ip * port)]] in the return value of the model
     [[recv()]]. For the |AF_INET| sockets used in the model, it is actually a
     |sockaddr_in| that is used: the |in_addr.s_addr| field corresponds to the
     [[ip]] and the |sin_port| field corresponds to the [[port]].

    \item the returned |ssize_t| is either non-negative, in which case it is the the amount
     of data that was received by the socket, or it is |-1| to indicate an error, in which
     case the error code is in |errno|. On WinXP an error is indicated by a return value of
     |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error code available through a
     call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  On WinXP, if the data from a datagram is not all read then the call fails with [[EMSGSIZE]],
  but still fills the |buffer| with data. This is modelled by the [[bool]] flag in the model
  [[recv()]]: if it is set to [[T]] then the call succeeded and read all of the datagrams's data; if
  it is set to [[F]] then the call failed with [[EMSGSIZE]] but still returned data.

  There are other functions used to receive data on a socket. |recv()| is similar to
  |recvfrom()| except it does not have the |address| and |address_len|
  arguments. It is used when the source address of the data does not need to be returned from the
  call. |recvmsg()|, another input function, is a more general form of |recvfrom()|.

@modeldetails

  If the call blocks then the thread enters state [[Recv2(sid,n,opts)]] where:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item [[sid : sid]] is the identifier of the socket that the [[recv()]] call was made on,

    \item [[n : num]] is the number of bytes to be read, and

    \item [[opts : msgbflag list]] is the set of message flags.

  \end{itemize}

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item On FreeBSD, Linux, and WinXP, [[EFAULT]] can be returned if the |buffer|
    parameter points to memory not in a valid part of the process address space. This is an artefact
    of the C interface to |ioctl()| that is excluded by the clean interface used in the
    model [[recv()]].

    \item In Posix, |EIO| may be returned to indicated that an I/O error occurred while
    reading from or writing to the file system; this is not modelled here.

    \item |EINVAL| may be returned if the [[MSG_OOB]] flag is set and no out-of-band data is
    available; out-of-band data does not exist for UDP so this does not apply.

    \item |ENOTCONN| may be returned if the socket is not connected; this does not apply for
    UDP as the socket need not have a peer specified to receive datagrams.

    \item |ETIMEDOUT| can be returned due to a transmission timeout on a connection; UDP is
    not connection-oriented so this does not apply.

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking
     Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback
     function". This is not modelled here.

  \end{itemize}

   The following Linx message flags are not modelled: |MSG_NOSIGNAL|, |MSG_TRUNC|, and
  |MSG_ERRQUEUE|.

    @description

    Consider a UDP socket [[sid]], referenced by [[fd]]. It is not shutdown for reading, has no
    pending errors, and is bound to local port [[p1]]. Thread [[tid]] is in the [[Run]] state.

    The socket's receive queue has a datagram at its head with data [[data]] and source address
    [[i3,ps3]]. A call [[recv(fd,n0,opts0)]], from thread [[tid]], succeeds.

    A [[Lh_call(tid,recv(fd,n0,opts0))]] transition is made. The thread is left in state [[Ret
    (OK(IMPLODE data',SOME(i3,ps3)))]], where [[data']] is either:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item all of the data in the datagram, [[data]], if the amount of data requested [[n0]] is
       greater than or equal to the amount of data in the datagram, or

      \item the first [[n0]] bytes of [[data]] if [[n0]] is less than the amount of data in the
       datagram, unless the architecture is WinXP (see below).

    \end{itemize}

    If the [[MSG_PEEK]] option is set in [[opts0]] then the entire datagram stays on the receive
    queue; the next call to [[recv()]] will be able to access this datagram. Otherwise, the entire
    datagram is discarded from the receive queue, even if all of its data has not been read.

    @variation WinXP

    The amount of data in bytes requested, [[n0]], must be greater than or equal to the number of
    bytes of data in the datagram on the head of the receive queue. The boolean [[b]] equals [[T]],
    indicating that all of the datagram's data has been read. Otherwise refer to rule [[recv_20]].

    @modeldetails

    The amount of data requested, [[n0]], is clipped to a natural number from an integer, using
    [[clip_int_to_num]]. POSIX specifies an unsigned type for [[n0]] and this is one possible model
    thereof.

    The [[opts0]] argument to [[recv()]] is of type [[msgbflag list]], but it is converted to a set,
    [[opts]], using [[LIST_TO_SET]].

    The data itself is represented as a [[byte list]] in the datagram but is returned a [[string]]:
    the [[IMPLODE]] function is used to do the conversion.

    @internal

    When a [[recv]] call is made on a UDP socket with data on the receive queue, data will be
    returned. If the amount of data requested, [[n]], is less than the amount of data in the
    datagram on the head of the receive queue, then on Linux and BSD, this amount of data is
    returned. On Windows, all of the data in the datagram is returned, but only when the amount of
    requested data is equal to or greater than the amount of data in the first datagram.

    If the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag is set then the datagram is left on the receive queue, otherwise it is
    removed, even if only some of the data it contains has been read.

   On WinXP, consider a UDP socket [[sid]] bound to a local port [[p1]] and with no pending
   errors. At the head of the socket's receive queue is a datagram with source address [[is := i3;
   ps := ps3]] and data [[data]]. This rule covers two cases:

   In the first, from thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[recv(fd,n0,opts0)]] call is
   made where [[fd]] refers to the socket [[sid]]. The amount of data to be read, [[n0]] bytes, is
   less than the number of bytes of data in the datagram, [[data]]. The call successfully returns
   the first [[n0]] bytes of data from the datagram, [[data']]. A [[Lh_call(tid,recv(fd,n0,opts0))]]
   transition is made leaving the thread state [[Ret (OK(IMPLODE data',SOME((i3,ps3),F)))]] where
   the [[F]] indicates that not all of the datagram's data was read. The datagram is discarded from
   the socket's receive queue unless the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag was set in [[opts0]], in which case the
   whole datagram remains on the socket's receive queue.

   In the second case, thread [[tid]] is blocked in state [[Recv2(sid,n,opts)]] where the number of
   bytes to be read, [[n]], is less than the number of bytes of data in the datagram. There is now
   data to be read so a [[Lh_tau]] transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret (OK(IMPLODE
   data',SOME((i3,ps3),F)))]] where the [[F]] indicated that not all of the datagram's data was
   read. The datagram is discarded from the socket's receive queue unless the [[MSG_PEEK]] flag was
   set in [[opts]], in which case the whole datagram remains on the socket's receive queue.

   @variation Posix

   This rule does not apply.

   @variation FreeBSD

   This rule does not apply.

   @variation Linux

   This rule does not apply.

   @modeldetails

   The amount of data requested, [[n0]], is clipped to a natural number from an integer, using
   [[clip_int_to_num]]. POSIX specifies an unsigned type for [[n0]] and this is one possible model
   thereof.

   The data itself is represented as a [[byte list]] in the datagram but is returned a [[string]],
   so the [[IMPLODE]] function is used to do the conversion.

   In the model the return value is [[OK(IMPLODE data',SOME((i3,p3),F))]] where the [[F]] represents
   not all the data in the datagram at the head of the socket's receive queue being read. What
   actually happens is that an [[EMSGSIZE]] error is returned, and the data is put into the read
   buffer specified when the [[recv()]] call was made.

   @internal

   On Windows, calling [[recv]] on a UDP socket with the amount of data requested less than the
   amount of data in the first datagram on the socket's receive queue fails with an [[EMSGSIZE]]
   error. However, the data is still placed in the buffer passed in the [[recv()]] call. The
   datagram is discarded from the socket's receive queue.

@section [[tcp_send]] TCP [[send()]]
 \[ <[send: fd * (ip * port) option * string * msgbflag list -> string ]> \]

  This section describes
  the behaviour of [[send()]] for TCP sockets.
  A call to [[send(fd,NONE,data,flags)]] enqueues data on the TCP socket's send queue.
  Here
  [[fd]] is a file descriptor referring to the TCP socket to enqueue data on.
  The second argument, of type [[(ip * port) option]], is the destination address of the data for UDP, but for
  a TCP socket it should be set to [[NONE]] (the socket must be
  connected to a peer before [[send()]] can be called).
  The   [[data]] is the data to be sent.
  Finally, [[flags]] is a list of flags for the [[send()]] call; possible flags are: [[MSG_OOB]], specifying
  that the data to be sent is out-of-band data, and [[MSG_DONTWAIT]], specifying that non-blocking
  behaviour is to be used for this call. The [[MSG_WAITALL]] and [[MSG_PEEK]] flags may also be set,
  but as they are meaningless for [[send()]] calls, FreeBSD ignores them, and Linux and WinXP fail
  with [[EOPNOTSUPP]].
  The returned [[string]] is any data that was not sent.

  For a successful [[send()]] call, the socket must be in a synchronised state, must not be shutdown
  for writing, and must not have a pending error.

  If there is not enough room on a socket's send queue then a [[send()]] call may block until space
  becomes available. For a successful blocking [[send()]] call on FreeBSD the entire string will be
  enqueued on the socket's send queue.

@errors

  In addition to errors returned via ICMP (see {@link [[deliver_in_icmp_3]]}), a call to [[send()]]
  can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception is raised:

  @error [[EAGAIN]] Non-blocking [[send()]] call would block.

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EBADF]]

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EINTR]]

  @error [[ENOTCONN]] Socket not connected on FreeBSD and WinXP.

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOTSOCK]]

  @error [[EOPNOTSUPP]] Message flags [[MSG_PEEK]] and [[MSG_WAITALL]] not supported. Linux and WinXP.

  @error [[EPIPE]] Socket not connected on Linux; or socket shutdown for writing on FreeBSD and Linux.

  @error [[ESHUTDOWN]] Socket shutdown for writing on WinXP.

@commoncases

  A TCP socket is created and successfully connects with a peer; data is then sent to the peer:
  [[socket_1]]; [[return_1]]; [[connect_1]]; [[return_1]]; $\dots $ [[connect_2]]; [[return_1]];
  [[send_1]]; $\dots $

@api

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:  &  |ssize_t send(int socket, const void *buffer, size_t length, int flags);| \\
    FreeBSD:&  |ssize_t send(int s, const void *msg, size_t len, int flags);| \\
    Linux:  &  |int send(int s, const void *msg, size_t len, int flags);| \\
    WinXP:  &  |int send(SOCKET s, const char *buf, int len, int flags);| \\
  \end{tabular}\\

  In the Posix interface:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |socket| is the file descriptor of the socket to send from, corresponding to the
     [[fd]] argument of the model [[send()]].

    \item |message| is a pointer to the data to be sent of length |length|. The two
     together correspond to the [[string]] argument of the model [[send()]].

    \item |flags| is a disjunction of the message flags for the [[send()]] call, corresponding to
     the [[msgbflag]] [[list]] in the model [[send()]].

     \item the returned |ssize_t| is either non-negative or |-1|. If it is
     non-negative then it is the amount of data from |message| that was sent. If it is
     |-1| then it indicates an error, in which case the error is stored in
     |errno|. This corresponds to the model [[send()]]'s return value of type [[string]]
     which is the data that was not sent. On WinXP an error is indicated by a return value of
     |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error code available through a
     call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  The FreeBSD, Linux and WinXP interfaces are similar modulo argument renaming, except where
  noted above.

@modeldetails

  If the call blocks then the thread enters state [[Send2(sid,NONE,str,opts)]] (the optional
  parameter is used for UDP only), where

  \begin{itemize}

    \item [[sid : sid]] is the identifier of the socket that made the [[send()]] call,

    \item [[str : string]] is the data to be sent, and

    \item [[opts : msgbflag list]] is the set of options for the [[send()]] call.

  \end{itemize}

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item In Posix and on all three architectures, |EDESTADDRREQ| indicates that the socket is not
    connection-mode and no peer address is set.  This doesn't apply to TCP, which is a
    connection-mode protocol.

   \item In Posix, |EACCES| signifies that write access to the socket is denied. This is not
   modelled here.

   \item On FreeBSD and Linux, |EFAULT| signifies that the pointers passed as either the |address| or
   |address_len| arguments were inaccessible.  This is an artefact of the C interface to
   [[accept()]] that is excluded by the clean interface used in the model.

    \item In Posix and on Linux, |EINVAL| signifies that an invalid argument was passed. The typing
     of the model interface prevents this from happening.

    \item In Posix, |EIO| signifies that an I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
    file system. This is not modelled.

    \item On Linux, |EMSGSIZE| indicates that the message is too large to be sent all at once, as
    the socket requires; this is not a requirement for TCP sockets.

    \item In Posix, |ENETDOWN| signifies that the local network interface used to reach the
    destination is down. This is not modelled.

  \end{itemize}

  The following flags are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item On Linux, |MSG_CONFIRM| is used to tell the link layer not to probe the neighbour.

  \item On Linux, |MSG_NOSIGNAL| requests not to send |SIGPIPE| errors on stream-oriented sockets
  when the other end breaks the connection.

  \item On FreeBSD and WinXP, |MSG_DONTROUTE| is used by routing programs.

  \item On FreeBSD, |MSG_EOR| is used to indicate the end of a record for protocols that support
   this. It is not modelled because TCP does not support records.

   \item On FreeBSD, |MSG_EOF| is used to implement Transaction TCP which is not modelled here.

  \end{itemize}

    @description

    From thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[send(fd,NONE,IMPLODE str,opts0)]] call
    is made. [[fd]] refers to a TCP socket [[sid]] that has binding quad [[(SOME i1,SOME p1,SOME
    i2,SOME p2)]], has no pending error, is not shutdown for writing, and is in state
    [[ESTABLISHED]] or [[CLOSE_WAIT]]. The [[MSG_PEEK]] and [[MSG_WAITALL]] flags are not set in
    [[opts0]]. [[space]] is the space in the socket's send queue, calculated using {@link
    [[send_queue_space]]}.

    This rule covers two cases: (1) there is space in the socket's send queue for all the data; and
    (2) there is not space for all the data but the call is non-blocking (the [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag
    is set in [[opts]] or the socket's [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is set), and the space is greater than
    zero, or, on FreeBSD, greater than the minimum number of bytes for [[send()]] operations on the
    socket, [[sf.n(SO_SNDLOWAT)]].

    In (1) all of the data [[str]] is appended to the socket's send queue and the returned
    string, [[str'']], is the empty string. In (2), the first [[space]] bytes of data, [[str']], are
    appended to the socket's send queue and the remaining data, [[str'']], is returned.

    In both cases a [[Lh_call(tid,send(fd,NONE,IMPLODE str,opts0))]] transition is made,
    leaving the thread state [[Ret (OK (IMPLODE str''))]]. If the data was marked as out-of-band,
    [[MSG_OOB IN opts]], then the socket's send urgent pointer will point to the end of the send
    queue.

    @variation FreeBSD

    The [[MSG_PEEK]] and [[MSG_WAITALL]] flags may be set in [[opts0]] but for the call to be
    non-blocking the socket's [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag must be set: the [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag has no
    effect.

    @modeldetails

    The data to be sent is of type [[string]] in the [[send()]] call but is a [[byte]] [[list]] when
    the datagram is constructed. Here the data, [[str]] is of type [[byte]] [[list]] and in the
    transition [[IMPLODE str]] is used to convert it into a string.

    The [[opts0]] argument is of type [[list]]. In the model it is converted to a [[set]] [[opts]]
    using [[LIST_TO_SET]]. The presence of [[MSG_PEEK]] is checked for in [[opts]] rather than in
    [[opts0]].

    @internal

    TODO: if MSG\_OOB in opts, should invoke tcp\_output with force\_output=T immediately

    Attempt to send data through a socket.  The socket must be connected, and only valid message
    options may be used.  We must not have already shut down this half of the connection.  There
    must be space remaining in the queue; note that out-of-band data gets special treatment here.
    We decide on [[n]], the number of bytes to accept onto the queue (at least [[SO_SNDLOWAT]] and
    at most the remaining space), and then append the first [[n]] bytes to the queue, returning the
    remainder.  We also set the send urgent pointer if necessary.

    Notice that in the rule above, if we send everything, we store / advance the OOB pointer.

    Our internal representation of the OOB pointer is akin to that of BSD, in that we point to the
    byte after the OOB byte (rather than the OOB byte itself).

    We really do not know when the OOB gets set.  Consider:

    [[send("ABCD",MSG_OOB)]]  returns 2
    [[send("XY",MSG_OOB)]] returns 2.... OOPS!!

    or, worse,

    [[send("ABCD",MSG_OOB)]] returns 2
    [[send("XY",0)]] returns 2..... !!!!!

    It seems reasonable only to set the OOB pointer when the D is written to the queue, but who
    knows if that is what is really done.

    From thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[send(fd,NONE,IMPLODE str,opts0)]] call
    is made. [[fd]] refers to a TCP socket that has binding quad [[(SOME i1,SOME p1,SOME i2,SOME
    p2)]], has no pending error, is not shutdown for writing, and is in state [[ESTABLISHED]] or
    [[CLOSE_WAIT]]. The call is a non-blocking one: either the socket's [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag is set
    or the [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag is set in [[opts0]]. The [[MSG_PEEK]] and [[MSG_WAITALL]] flags are
    not set in [[opts0]].

    The space in the socket's send queue, [[space]] (calculated using {@link [[send_queue_space]]}),
    is less than both the length of the data to send [[str]]; and on FreeBSD is less than the
    minimum number of bytes for socket send operations, [[sf.n(SO_SNDLOWAT)]], or on Linux and WinXP
    is equal to zero. The call would have to block, but because it is non-blocking, it fails with an
    [[EAGAIN]] error.

    A [[Lh_call(tid,send(fd,NONE,IMPLODE str,opts0))]] transition is made, leaving the thread in
    state [[Ret (FAIL EAGAIN)]].

    @variation FreeBSD

    For the call to be non-blocking, the socket's [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag must be set; the
    [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag is ignored. Additionally, the [[MSG_PEEK]] and [[MSG_WAITALL]] flags may
    be set in [[opts0]] as they are also ignored.

    @variation Linux

    This rule also applies if the socket is in state [[SYN_SENT]] or [[SYN_RECEIVED]], in which case
    the send queue size does not matter.

    @modeldetails

    The data to be sent is of type [[string]] in the [[send()]] call but is a [[byte]] [[list]] when
    the datagram is constructed. Here the data, [[str]] is of type [[byte]] [[list]] and in the
    transition [[IMPLODE str]] is used to convert it into a string.

    The [[opts0]] argument is of type [[list]]. In the model it is converted to a [[set]] [[opts]]
    using [[LIST_TO_SET]]. The presence of [[MSG_PEEK]] is checked for in [[opts]] rather than in

    Attempt to send data through a socket, but that socket has a pending error.  Return that error
    instead, and clear the error so that (unless another error arrives in the meantime) the next
    call will succeed.

    This covers the POSIX [[ECONNRESET]] case (we intend), and also [[ENETDOWN]] and
    [[ENETUNREACH]].  The latter, because [[send()]] does no sending itself; TCP does that.  Of
    course, a smart implementation might be able to return [[ENETDOWN]] immediately.  But should it?
    Or should it treat it as a soft error and wait for the user to plug it back in?  (note that we
    already have an established connection at this point).

    Why is this only dependent on [[es]], whereas the [[recv]] analogue requires [[st =
    ESTABLISHED]] also?

    A socket on which there is a blocked send() call has a pending error, causing the send() call

@section [[udp_send]] UDP [[send()]]
 \[ <[send: (fd * (ip * port) option * string * msgbflag list) -> string]> \]

  This section describes
  the behaviour of [[send()]] for UDP sockets.
  A call to [[send(fd,addr,data,flags)]] enqueues a UDP datagram to send to a peer.
  Here the [[fd]] argument is a file descriptor referring to a UDP socket from which to send data.
  The destination address of the data can be specified either by the [[addr]] argument, which can be
  [[SOME(i3,p3)]] or [[NONE]], or by the socket's peer address (its [[is2]] and [[ps2]] fields) if set. For a successful [[send()]], at least one of these two must be specified. If the socket
  has a peer address set and [[addr]] is set to [[SOME(i3,p3)]], then the address used is
  architecture-dependent: on FreeBSD the [[send()]] call will fail with an [[EISCONN]] error; on
  Linux and WinXP [[i3,p3]] will be used.

  The [[string]], [[data]], is the data to be sent. The length in bytes of [[data]] must be less
  than the architecture-dependent maximum payload for a UDP datagram. Sending a [[string]] of length
  zero bytes is acceptable.

  The [[msgbflag]] [[list]] is the list of message flags for the [[send()]] call. The possible flags
  are [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] and [[MSG_OOB]]. [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] specifies that non-blocking behaviour
  should be used for this call: see rules [[send_10]] and [[send_11]].  [[MSG_OOB]] specifies that
  the data to be sent is out-of-band data, which is not meaningful for UDP sockets.  FreeBSD ignores
  this flag, but on Linux and WinXP the [[send()]] call will fail: see rule [[send_20]].

  The return value of the [[send()]] call is a [[string]] of the data which was not sent. A partial
  send may occur when the call is interrupted by a signal after having sent some data.

  For a datagram to be sent, the socket must be bound to a local port. When a [[send()]] call is
  made, the socket is autobound to an ephemeral port if it does not have its local port bound.

  A successful [[send()]] call only guarantees that the datagram has been placed on the host's out
  queue. It does not imply that the datagram has left the host, let alone been successfully
  delivered to its destination.

  A call to [[send()]] may block if there is no room on the socket's send buffer and non-blocking
  behaviour has not been requested.

@errors

  In addition to errors returned via ICMP (see {@link [[deliver_in_icmp_3]]}), a call to [[send()]]
  can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception is raised:

  @error [[EADDRINUSE]] The socket's peer address is not set and the destination address specified
   would give the socket a binding quad [[i1,p1,i2,p2]] which is already in use by another
   socket.

  @error [[EADDRNOTAVAIL]] There are no ephemeral ports left for autobinding to.

  @error [[EAGAIN]] The [[send()]] call would block and non-blocking behaviour is requested. This
   may have been done either via the [[MSG_DONTWAIT]] flag being set in the [[send()]] flags or the
   socket's [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag being set.

  @error [[EDESTADDRREQ]] The socket does not have its peer address set, and no destination address
   was specified.

  @error [[EINTR]] A signal interrupted [[send()]] before any data was transmitted.

  @error [[EISCONN]] On FreeBSD, a destination address was specified and the socket has a peer
   address set.

  @error [[EMSGSIZE]] The message is too large to be sent in one datagram.

  @error [[ENOTCONN]] The socket does not have its peer address set, and no destination address was
   specified. This can occur either when the call is first made, or if it blocks and if the peer
   address is unset by a call to [[disconnect()]] whilst blocked.

  @error [[EOPNOTSUPP]] The [[MSG_OOB]] flag is set on Linux or WinXP.

  @error [[EPIPE]] Socket shut down for writing.

  \end{tabular}

  In the Posix interface:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |socket| is the file descriptor of the socket to send from, corresponding to the
     [[fd]] argument of the model [[send()]].

    \item |message| is a pointer to the data to be sent of length |length|. The two
     together correspond to the [[string]] argument of the model [[send()]].

    \item |flags| is an OR of the message flags for the [[send()]] call, corresponding to
     the [[msgbflag]] [[list]] in the model [[send()]].

    \item |dest_addr| and |dest_len| correspond to the [[addr]] argument of the
     model [[send()]]. |dest_addr| is either null or a pointer to a sockaddr structure
     containing the destination address for the data. If it is null it corresponds to [[addr =
     NONE]]. If it contains an address, then it corresponds to [[addr = SOME(i3,p3)]] where [[i3]]
     and [[p3]] are the IP address and port specified in the sockaddr structure.

    \item the returned |ssize_t| is either non-negative or |-1|. If it is
     non-negative then it is the amount of data from |message| that was sent. If it is
     |-1| then it indicates an error, in which case the error is stored in
     |errno|. This is different to the model [[send()]]'s return value of type [[string]]
     which is the data that was not sent. On WinXP an error is indicated by a return value of
     |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error code available through a
     call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  There are other functions used to send data on a socket. |send()| is similar to
  |sendto()| except it does not have the |address| and |address_len|
  arguments. It is used when the destination address of the data does not need to be
  specified. |sendmsg()|, another output function, is a more general form of
  |sendto()|.

@modeldetails

  If the call blocks then the thread enters state [[Send2(sid,SOME(addr,is1,ps1,is2,ps2),str,opts)]] where

  \begin{itemize}

    \item [[sid : sid]] is the identifier of the socket that made the [[send()]] call,

    \item [[addr : (ip * port) option]] is the destination address specified in the [[send()]] call,

    \item [[is1 : ip option]] is the socket's local IP address, possibly [[NONE]],

    \item [[ps1 : port option]] is the socket's local port, possibly [[NONE]],

    \item [[is2 : ip option]] is the IP address of the socket's peer, possibly [[NONE]],

    \item [[ps2 : ip option]] is the port of the socket's peer, possibly [[NONE]],

    \item [[str : string]] is the data to be sent, and

    \item [[opts : msgbflag list]] is the set of options for the [[send()]] call.

  \end{itemize}

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

   \item On FreeBSD, |EACCES| signifies that the destination address is a broadcast address and the
   |SO_BROADCAST| flag has not been set on the socket. Broadcast is not modelled here.

   \item In Posix, |EACCES| signifies that write access to the socket is denied. This is not
   modelled here.

   \item On FreeBSD and Linux, |EFAULT| signifies that the pointers passed as either the |address| or
   |address_len| arguments were inaccessible.  This is an artefact of the C interface to
   [[accept()]] that is excluded by the clean interface used in the model.

    \item In Posix and on Linux, |EINVAL| signifies that an invalid argument was passed. The typing
     of the model interface prevents this from happening.

    \item In Posix, |EIO| signifies that an I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
    file system. This is not modelled.

    \item In Posix, |ENETDOWN| signifies that the local network interface used to reach the
    destination is down. This is not modelled.

  \end{itemize}

  The following flags are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item On Linux, |MSG_CONFIRM| is used to tell the link layer not to probe the neighbour.

  \item On Linux, |MSG_NOSIGNAL| requests not to send |SIGPIPE| errors on stream-oriented sockets
  when the other end breaks the connection. UDP is not stream-oriented.

  \item On FreeBSD and WinXP, |MSG_DONTROUTE| is used by routing programs.

  \item On FreeBSD, |MSG_EOR| is used to indicate the end of a record for protocols that support
   this. It is not modelled because UDP does not support records.

   \item On FreeBSD, |MSG_EOF| is used to implement Transaction TCP.

    [[send(fd,addr,IMPLODE str,opts0)]] succeeds if:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item the length of [[str]] is less than {@link [[UDPpayloadMax]]}, the architecture-dependent
       maximum payload for a UDP datagram.

      \item The socket has a peer IP address set in its [[is2]] field or the [[addr]] argument is
       [[SOME(i3,p3)]], specifying a destination address.

      \item The socket is bound to a local port [[p1']], or it can be autobound to [[p1']] and
       [[sid]] added to the list of bound sockets.

      \item A UDP datagram is constructed from the socket's binding quad [[(sock.is1,SOME
       p1',sock.is2,sock.ps2)]], the destination address argument [[addr]], and the data
       [[str]]. This datagram is successfully enqueued on the outqueue of the host, [[oq]] to form
       outqueue [[oq']] using auxiliary function {@link [[dosend]]}.

    \end{itemize}

    A [[Lh_call(tid,send(fd,addr,IMPLODE str,opts0))]] transition is made, leaving the thread in
    state [[Ret (OK(""))]] and the host with new outqueue [[oq']]. If the socket was autobound to a
    port then [[sid]] is appended to the host's list of bound sockets.

    A datagram can be constructed using [[str]] as its data. The length in bytes of [[str]] is less
    than or equal to [[UDPpayloadMax]], the architecture-dependent maximum payload size for a UDP
    datagram. There are three possible destination addresses:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item [[addr]], the destination address specified in the [[send()]] call.
      \item [[is2,ps2]], the socket's peer address when the [[send()]] call was made.
      \item [[sock.is2,sock.ps2]], the socket's current peer address.
    \end{itemize}

    At least one of [[addr]], [[is2]], and [[sock.is2]] must specify an IP address: they are not all
    set to [[NONE]]. One of the three addresses will be used as the destination address of the
    datagram.  The datagram can be successfully enqueued on the host's outqueue, [[h.oq]], resulting
    in a new outqueue [[oq']].

    An [[Lh_tau]] transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret (OK(""))]], and the host
    with new outqueue [[oq']].

    @internal

    Note that the [[Send2]] state can only be entered by the [[send_10]] rule (in the UDP case).
    Unfortunately, this does not guarantee that the socket's [[is2]] and [[ps2]] will be present,
    because a call to [[disconnect]] may have removed them.  We allow for a successful send to occur
    based on the values in the socket when the call was made however.

    @description

    Consider a UDP socket [[sid]] with no pending errors. The thread [[tid]] is blocked in state
    [[Send2(sid,SOME(addr,is1,ps1,is2,ps2),str)]].

    A datagram is constructed with [[str]] as its payload. Its destination address is taken from
    [[addr]], the destination address specified when the [[send()]] call was made, or
    [[(is2,ps2)]], the socket's peer address when the [[send()]] call was made. It is possible to
    enqueue the datagram on the host's outqueue, [[h.oq]].

    This rule covers two cases. In the first, the length in bytes of [[str]] is greater than
    [[UDPpayloadMax]], the architecture-dependent maximum payload size for a UDP datagram. The error
    [[EMSGSIZE]] is returned.

    In the second case, the original [[send()]] call did not have a destination address specified:
    [[addr = NONE]], and the socket has had the IP address of its peer address unset:
    [[sock.is2=NONE]].  The peer address of the socket when the [[send()]] call was made,
    [[(is2,ps2)]], is ignored, and an [[ENOTCONN]] error is returned.

    In either case, a [[Lh_tau]] transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret (FAIL e)]]
    where [[e]] is either [[EMSGSIZE]] or [[ENOTCONN]].

    @variation FreeBSD

    An [[EMSGSIZE]] error can also be returned if the size of [[str]] is greater than the value of
    the socket's [[SO_SNDBUF]] option.

    @variation WinXP

    Any pending error on the socket is ignored.

    @internal

    This rule nondeterministically competes with rules [[send_15]] which allows a message to be
    enqueued using [[(is2,ps2)]], the socket's peer address when the [[send()]] call was made.

    This case non-deterministically competes with rule [[send_13]]: the [[EMSGSIZE]] error can be
    returned either when the [[send()]] call is first made, or when the datagram is enqueued on the
    host's outqueue.

    The condition ensures it fires only when we try to put the message onto the outqueue, modelling
    the discovery at that point that the message is too large, or that the socket has become
    disconnected.  (This rule nondeterministically competes with [[send_13]], which would catch an
    outsize message earlier, and with [[send_15]], which would allow the delivery of a message on a
    now-disconnected socket based on the values of [[sock.is2]] and [[sock.ps2]] when the call was
    made.)

    This rule leaves the socket state unchanged.  One might wish to allow it to have been disturbed,
    nondeterministically.

  In the Posix interface:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |fildes| is a file descriptor for the file to retrieve flags from. It corresponds
     to the [[fd]] argument of the model [[setfileflags()]]. On WinXP the |s| is a socket
     descriptor corresponding to the [[fd]] argument of the model [[setfileflags()]].

    \item |cmd| is a command to perform an operation on the file. This is set to
     |F_GETFL| for the model [[setfileflags()]]. On WinXP, |cmd| is set to
     |FIONBIO| to get the [[O_NONBLOCK]] flag; there is no [[O_ASYNC]] flag on WinXP.

    \item The call takes a variable number of arguments. For the model [[setfileflags()]] it takes
     three arguments: the two described above and a third of type |long| which represents
     the list of flags to set, corresponding to the [[flags]] argument of the model
     [[setfileflags()]]. On WinXP this is the |argp| argument.

    \item The returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
     indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is
     indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error
     code available through a call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

    \item |WSAENOTSOCK| is a possible error on WinXP as the |ioctlsocket()| call is

    The type of [[t]] is [[(int * int) option]], but the type of a time-option socket flag is

    Typing ensures [[f]] is valid and is a time-option flag.

    Note that the type of the argument is an optional pair of integers, as defined by
    [[time_of_tltimeopt]]: absence denotes infinity, pair is seconds and nanoseconds respectively.

    We only accept nonnegative times.  This cannot be enforced by typing, because we do not have
    unsigned types in TL.  Not clear what error we should raise if this fails.

    There's a bit of a hack here (an irregularity in our LIB API); [[0]] means [[NONE]] as a

    On WinXP, from thread [[tid]], which is in the [[Run]] state, a [[setsocktopt(fd,f,t)]] call is
    made. [[fd]] is a file descriptor referring to a UDP socket [[sid]], [[f]] is the time-option
    socket [[SO_LINGER]]. The flag [[f]] is not settable, so the call fails with an [[ENOPROTOOPT]]
    error.

    A [[Lh_call(tid,setsocktopt(fd,f,t))]] transition is made, leaving the thread state [[Ret

    If the user attempts to set an option that is not settable, the error [[ENOPROTOOPT]] is

    NB: On BSD/LINUX you can get/set [[SO_LINGER]] on a UDP socket. On WinXP this fails.

    This is currently nondeterministic for those options POSIX permits to be nonsettable.  We should

@section [[shutdown]] ALL [[shutdown()]]
  \[ <[shutdown: (fd * bool * bool) -> unit]> \]

  A call of [[shutdown(fd,r,w)]] shuts down either the read-half of a connection, the write-half of
  a connection, or both. The [[fd]] is a file descriptor referring to the socket to shutdown; the [[r]] and [[w]] indicate whether the socket should be shut down for reading and writing respectively.

  For a TCP socket, shutting down the read-half empties the socket's receive queue, but data will
  still be delivered to it and subsequent [[recv()]] calls will return data. Shutting down the
  write-half of a TCP connection causes the remaining data in the socket's send queue to be sent and
  then TCP's connection termination to occur.

  For Linux and WinXP, a TCP socket may only be shut down if it is in the [[ESTABLISHED]] state; on
  FreeBSD a socket may be shut down in any state.

  For a UDP socket, if the socket is shutdown for reading, data may still be read from the socket's
  receive queue on Linux, but on FreeBSD and WinXP this is not the case. Shutting down the socket
  for writing causes subsequent [[send()]] calls to fail.


@errors

  A call to [[shutdown()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception
  is raised:

  @error [[ENOTCONN]] The socket is not connected and so cannot be shut down.
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[EBADF]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOTSOCK]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOBUFS]]

@commoncases

 A TCP socket is created and connects to a peer; data is transferred between the two; the socket has
 no more data to send so calls [[shutdown()]] to inform the peer of this: [[socket_1]]; $\dots $;
 [[connect_1]]; $\dots $; [[shutdown_1]]; [[return_1]]

@api

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:   & |int shutdown(int socket, int how);| \\
    FreeBSD: & |int shutdown(int s, int how);| \\
    Linux:   & |int shutdown(int s, int how);| \\
    WinXP:   & |int shutdown(SOCKET s, int how);|
  \end{tabular}

  In the Posix interface:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |socket| is a file descriptor referring to the socket to shut down. This
     corresponds to the [[fd]] argument of the model [[shutdown()]].

    \item |how| is an integer specifying the type of shutdown corresponding to the [[(r,w)]]
     arguments in the model [[shutdown()]]. If |how| is set to |SHUT_RD| then the
     read half of the connection is to be shut down, corresponding to a [[shutdown(fd,T,F)]] call in
     the model; if it is set to |SHUT_WR| then the write half of the connection is to be
     shut down, corresponding to a [[shutdown(fd,F,T)]] call in the model; if it is set to
     |SHUT_RDWR| then both the read and write halves of the connection are to be shut down,
     corresponding to a [[shutdown(fd,T,T)]] call in the model.

    \item the returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
     indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is
     indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error
     code available through a call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  The FreeBSD, Linux, and WinXP interfaces are similar, except where noted.

@modeldetails

  The following errors are not modelled:
  \begin{itemize}

    \item |EINVAL| signifies that the |how| argument is invalid. In the model the
     |how| argument is represented by the two boolean flags [[r]] and [[w]] which guarantees
     that the only values allowed are [[(T,T)]], [[(T,F)]], [[(F,T)]], and [[(F,F)]]. The first
     three correspond to the allowed values of |how|: |SHUT_RD|,
     |SHUT_WR|, and |SHUT_RDWR|. The last possible value, [[(F,F)]], is not
     allowed by Posix, but the model allows a [[shutdown(fd,F,F)]] call,
     which has no effect on the socket.

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking
     Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback
     function". This is not modelled here.

    The call suceeds: a [[Lh_call(tid,shutdown(fd,r,w))]] transition is made, leaving the thread in

    @variation FreeBSD

    The TCP socket can be in any state, not just [[ESTABLISHED]]. If the socket is in the [[CLOSED]]
    or [[LISTEN]] and is to be shutdown for writing, [[w=T]], then the socket is closed, see {@link
    [[tcp_close]]}.

    Note that testing has shown the socket's listen queue is not always set to [[NONE]] after a
    [[shutdown()]] call. The precise condition for this being done needs to be investigated.

    @internal

    Close the read half of the connection (if requested), by setting the appropriate bit in the
    socket state and emptying the [[rcvq]]; close the write half (if requested), by setting the
    appropriate bit in the socket state.

    I'm pretty sure (but do not have the POSIX ref to prove it, CHECK!)  that [[shutdown()]] does not
    check the pending error flag.

    It's a LIB API decision here that [[shutdown(fd,F,F)]] is legal, and simply does nothing (after
    checking that [[fd]] refers to a socket).

    Note that we do not send a FIN here; that is left to the protocol layer.  (perhaps it should be
    in [[close_2a]] also?).

    UNPv1p160 says that if we shut down the read half, TCP should still ACK data it receives, and
    just silently drop it on the floor.  TODO: do we do this?

    \item |s| is a file descriptor referring to a socket. This corresponds to the [[fd]]

    \item the returned |int| is either |0| or |1| to indicate success or

     socket is not at the urgent mark, corresponding to a return value of [[F]] in the model.

  \end{itemize}

  The FreeBSD, Linux, and WinXP interfaces are significantly different: to check whether or not a
  socket is at the urgent mark, the |ioctl()| function must be used. In the FreeBSD
  interface:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |d| is a file descriptor referring to a socket, corresponding to the [[fd]]
     argument of the model [[sockatmark()]].

    \item |request| selects which control function is to be performed. For [[sockatmark()]],
     the request is |SIOCATMARK|.

    \item |argp| is a pointer to a location to store the result of the call in. If the
     socket is at the urgent mark then |1| will be in the location pointed to by
     |argp| upon return, corresponding to a return value of [[T]] in the model
     [[sockatmark()]]; if the socket is not at the urgent mark, then |argp| will contain the
     value |0|, corresponding to a return value of [[F]] in the model.

    \item the returned |int| is either |0| to indicate success or |-1| to
     indicate an error, in which case the error code is in |errno|.  On WinXP an error is
     indicated by a return value of |SOCKET_ERROR|, not |-1|, with the actual error
     code available through a call to |WSAGetLastError()|.

  \end{itemize}

  The Linux and WinXP interfaces are similar.

@modeldetails

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item On FreeBSD, Linux, and WinXP, [[EFAULT]] can be returned if the |argp| parameter
    points to memory not in a valid part of the process address space. This is an artefact of the C
    interface to |ioctl()| that is excluded by the clean interface used in the model
    [[sockatmark()]].

    \item On FreeBSD and Linux, [[EINVAL]] can be returned if |request| is not a valid
     request. The model [[sockatmark()]] is implemented using the |SIOCATMARK| request which
     is valid.

    \item [[ENOTTY]] is possible when making an [[ioctl()]] call but is not modelled.

    \item |WSAEINPROGRESS| is WinXP-specific and described in the MSDN page as "A blocking

  A call to [[socket(type)]] creates a new socket. Here [[type]] is the type of socket to create:
  [[SOCK_STREAM]] for TCP and [[SOCK_DGRAM]] for UDP. The returned [[fd]] is the file descriptor of
  the new socket.

@errors

  A call to [[socket()]] can fail with the errors below, in which case the corresponding exception
  is raised:

  @error [[EMFILE]] No more file descriptors for this process.

  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENOMEM]]
  @errorinclude [[misc]] [[ENFILE]]


 @commoncases

  TCP: [[socket_1]]; [[return_1]]; [[connect_1]]; $\dots$
  UDP: [[socket_1]]; [[return_1]]; [[bind_1]]; [[return_1]]; [[send_9]]; $\dots$

@api

  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    Posix:  &  |int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);| \\
    FreeBSD:&  |int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);| \\
    Linux:  &  |int socket(int doamin, int type, int protocol);| \\
    WinXP:  &  |SOCKET socket(int af, int type, int protocol);| \\
  \end{tabular}\\

  In the Posix interface:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item |domain| specifies the communication domain in which the socket is to be created,
    specifying the protocol family to be used. Only IPv4 sockets are modelled here, so
    |domain| is set to |AF_INET| or |PF_INET|.

    \item |type| specifies the communication semantics: |SOCK_STREAM| provides
          sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams; |SOCK_DGRAM|
          supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed maximum length). This
          corresponds to the [[sock_type]] argument of the model [[socket()]].

    \item |protocol| specifies the particular protocol to be used for the socket. A
    |protocol| of |0| requests to use the default for the appropriate socket
    |type|: TCP for |SOCK_STREAM| and UDP for |SOCK_DGRAM|. Alternatively
    a specific protocol number can be used: |6| for TCP and |17| for UDP. In the
    model, [[SOCK_STREAM]] refers to a TCP socket and [[SOCK_DGRAM]] to a UDP socket so the
    |protocol| argument is not necessary.

  \end{itemize}

  A call to [[socket(SOCK_STREAM)]] in the model interface, would be a
  |socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0)| call in Posix; a call to [[socket(SOCK_DGRAM)]] in the
  model interface would be a |socket(AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM,0)| call in Posix.

  The FreeBSD, Linux and WinXP interfaces are similar modulo argument renaming, except where noted
  above.


@modeldetails

  The following errors are not modelled:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item In Posix and on Linux, |EACCES| specifies that the process does not have appropriate
    privileges.  We do not model a privilege state in which socket creation would be disallowed.

    \item In Posix and  on Linux, |EAFNOSUPPORT|, specifies that the implementation does not
    support the address |domain|. FreeBSD, Linux, and WinXP all support |AF_INET|
    sockets.

    \item On Linux, |EINVAL| means unknown protocol, or protocol domain not available. Both
    TCP and UDP are known protocols for Linux, and |AF_INET| is a known domain on Linux.

    \item In Posix and on Linux, |EPROTONOTSUPPORT| specifies that the protocol is not
    supported by the address family, or the protocol is not supported by the
    implementation. FreeBSD, Linux, and WinXP all support the TCP and UDP protocols.

    \item In Posix, |EPROTOTYPE| signifies that the socket type is not supported by the
    protocol. Both |SOCK_STREAM| and |SOCK_DGRAM| are supported by TCP and UDP
    respectively.

    \item On WinXP, |WSAESOCKTNOSUPPORT| means the specified socket type is not supported in
    this address family. The |AF_INET| family supports both |SOCK_STREAM| and
    |SOCK_DGRAM| sockets.

  \end{itemize}

  The |AF_INET6|, |AF_LOCAL|, |AF_ROUTE|, and |AF_KEY| address
  families; |SOCK_RAW| socket type; and all protocols other than TCP and UDP are not modelled.

    SB: Have rolled all the individual EINTR rules into this one rule

    If a user call to [[accept()]] is blocked, i.e., is in the [[Accept2]] state, and a signal is
    caught (and handled), the call SHALL fail with error [[EINTR]].  (If the signal is not caught,
    control does not return and so the behaviour is irrelevant).

    Similarly for [[connect()]] and [[Connect2]], [[close()]] and [[Close2()]]

    POSIX: "shall fail..." if "interrupted by a signal that was caught before a valid connection
    arrived".  NOTE: we'd better make [[accept_1a]] urgent, so this is not invalid.

    This is purely nondeterministic here since we do not yet model signals.

[[deliver_in_2]] deals with the completion of an active open: a socket in [[SYN_SENT]] state (that has previously sent a [[SYN]] with the [[connect_1]] rule) that receives a [[SYN,ACK]] and sends an [[ACK]].  It also deals with simultaneous opens.

[[deliver_in_3]] deals with the common cases of TCP data exchange and connection close: sockets in connected states that receive data, [[ACK]]s, and [[FIN]]s.
This rule is structured using the relational monad, combining auxiliaries
[[di3_topstuff]], [[di3_ackstuff]], [[di3_datastuff]] etc., to factor out many of the imperative effects of the code.

The other rules deal with [[RST]]s and a variety of pathological situations.

    description

    ---- Alternative (BUT INCOMPLETE) text ----

    <insert some short overview paragraph here>

    The segment [[seg]] at the head of the host's input queue is addressed to the [[IP]] address
    [[i1]] assigned to one of the interfaces of host [[h]]. Address [[i1]] is not a link-layer
    broadcast or IP-multicast address. The TCP socket referenced by [[sid]] is the socket that has
    the most specific address quad matching the segment's address quad and is in the [[LISTEN]]
    state. The socket's remote address pair [[is2]] and [[ps2]] most both be [[NONE]].

    If the socket's local address [[is1]] is not a wildcard ([[NONE]]), the local address of the
    socket must be the [[IP]] address the segment was destined for, \ie, [[i1]]. Also, the segment
    must not have been sent from the socket itself as no sequence of socket calls exists to achieve
    a self-connect on a socket once in the [[LISTEN]] state. (Note: self-connects are possible and
    these are modelled through the simultaneous open behaviour of {@link [[deliver_in_2]]}).

    If another socket also matches the incoming segment and this socket is in the [[TIME_WAIT]]
    state, the new connection is only permitted to proceed if the new [[SYN]]'s sequence number is
    greater than the highest sequence number seen on the [[TIME_WAIT]] socket, [[rcv_nxt]], in which
    case the [[TIME_WAIT]] socket is closed and the new connection is allowed to proceed.

    The connection is allowed to proceed only if the socket's completed connections queue [[q0]] is
    not full and is added to the end of the socket's incomplete connection queue. On FreeBSD the
    incomplete connection queue is modelled by a SYN cache which itself, or one of its buckets, may
    be full, in which case the oldest connection is dropped from either the bucket or cache,
    whichever was full. This is modelled by allowing any single arbitrary connection to be dropped
    from the incomplete connections queue.

    At this stage the received segment is valid and a new connection attempt proceeds, \ie, this rule
    matches.  A [[SYN]],[[ACK]] segment is created in reply to the initial [[SYN]] segment, the
    socket's control........

    @description

    TODO3

    @variation FreeBSD

    On FreeBSD, the [[listen()]] socket call can be called on a TCP socket in any state, thus it is
    possible for a listening TCP socket to have a peer address, \ie, [[is2]] and [[ps2]] pair,
    specified. This in turn affects the behaviour of connection establishment because an incoming
    [[SYN]] segment only matches this type of listening socket if its address quad matches the
    socket's entire address quad, heavily restricting the usefulness of such a socket.

    Such a restrictive peer address binding is permitted by the model for FreeBSD only.


    @modeldetails

    During TCP connection establishment, BSD uses syn-caches and syn-buckets to protect against some
    types of denial-of-service attack. These techniques delay the memory allocation for a socket's
    data structures until connection establishment is complete. They are not modelled directly in
    this specification, which instead favours the use of the full socket structure for clarity. The
    behaviour is observationally equivalent provided correct bounds are applied to the lengths of
    the incoming connection queues.

    When a socket completes connection establishment, \ie, enters the [[ESTABLISHED]] state, BSD
    updates the socket's control block [[t_maxseg]] field to the minimum of the maximum segment size
    it advertised in the emitted SYN,ACK segment and that received in the SYN segment from the
    remote end. This update is later than perhaps it need be. This model updates the [[t_maxseg]] at
    the moment both the maximum segment values are known. As a consequence the initial maximum
    segment value advertised by the host must be stored just in case the SYN,ACK segment need be
    retransmitted.


    @internal

    We're not bothering with syncaches or syncookies at the moment, assuming that observationally
    they're the same as doing the obvious thing.

    any seq OK; ack probably zero but we should be permissive
    URG,PSH presumably OK if we're sending data in SYN packet (unusual but permitted)

    observe: FIN and data are OK, but we ignore it.  This models the BSD syncache behaviour.
    Essentially, it means that we'll only ACK the SYN, and the other end will have to retransmit any
    data and FIN once we're in a state capable of dealing with it.

    old comment follows:
    FIN means: need to set cantrcvmore or whatever, and maybe move to CLOSE\_WAIT??
    T allowed by TCP but never sent by BSD so do not try it just now
    FIN is in fact OK too: see RFC1025 and TCPv1p230; that would be a lamp-test packet

    data OK, although it looks like BSD's syncachey impl just drops it silently: should allow
    (nondet) anything between dropping and accepting, including accepting only n bytes (recall that
    we have not been able yet to advertise a window, so the remote end is guessing (unless it's less
    than 536 bytes? 235 bytes? which it has a right to expect is OK if you're doing that) (OTOH,
    what about a syncache that stores only say 16 bytes?? it's at least conceivable)

    scaling: if seg.scale is NONE then we cannot do scaling ourselves either.  Note that fact.
    Otherwise, we should log their preferred scale and we should set and send our own; or we could
    say seg'.scale is NONE too, in which case we are saying that neither of us is allowed to do
    scaling ("I do not understand that option").

    TCPv2pp933ff: tcp\_dooptions this implies that in a passive open, we do not need to remember
    either requested\_s\_scale or request\_r\_scale; in an active open, we'd need to remember what
    we said (i.e., request\_r\_scale) in fact, observe that in our model we only save
    request\_r\_scale, not requested\_s\_scale, and we initialise snd\_scale and rcv\_scale earlier
    than in BSD (i.e., at LISTEN -> SYN\_RECEIVED rather than at SYN\_RECEIVED->ESTABLISHED), simply
    not using their values if we're in SYN\_RECEIVED.  This is a nice simplification, but it is one
    thing that will make white-box testing a little less convenient (rcv\_adv is another)

    urp unconstrained

    now need to nondet decide if we will advertise or not?  Can we only make this choice if
    t\_maxseg' = 536, or is it an inequality?  see also RFC1122 4.2.2.6: RFC791 says that not
    sending it means any segment size is OK, but RFC1122 says impls SHOULD send it if it's not 536,
    and MAY send it if it is this suggests that we should nondet allow not sending an MSS option,
    irrespective of t\_maxseg'

    OK, based on TCPv2p903 we're all of a sudden very confused as to whether we need to *agree* on
    an MSS, or store independent MSSs for each direction (i.e., just store our send mss but do not
    require the other end to obey any particular mss), or if there are some weirder constraints.
    Also TCPv1p237 has something.

    and then, what about path MTU?? Highly amusing(?): ip\_icmp.c:791 has a list of all path MTUs
    possible

    ISS picking: note that the magic that creates this number should be sensitive to the special
    magic performed when receiving a SYN while in TIME\_WAIT; search for "iss = " in tcp\_input, or
    TCPv2p945.

    Reconnection of TIME\_WAIT sockets - BSD tcp\_input.c:1486 allows certain reconnections in
    TIME\_WAIT, but not \_these\_ ones

    BSD tcp_input.c:1486 says that if a new connection request comes in, and there happens to be an
    old connection still in TIME_WAIT, the old connection can be disregarded (as far as making a new
    connection goes) and is closed.

    (* MS: the below is unconstraining the advertised receive window, which allows it to account for
           BSD behaviour of increasing the window from 57344 (default; tcp_recvspace) to 57920 after
           the first segment has been sent:

           (1) deliver_in_1/connect_1 - first segment sent out, has initial value of tp->rcv_wnd =
                                        tcp_recvspace = 57344 (set in tcp_attach), subsequent sent
                                        segments have this same window until we receive a segment
                                        from the other end (i.e. tcp_input is called).  Note that
                                        the initial SYN of a passive open does not count, as this is
                                        handled by the syncache.

           (2) deliver_in_2/deliver_in_3 - first segment received. From now onwards, tp->rcv_wnd is
                                           set by tcp_input to max(space in rcvbuf,current window)
                                           [see tcp_input.c line 1052]. Since the rcvbuffer is
                                           initially empty, rcv_wnd gets set to the rcvbuf size,
                                           i.e.  57920 (tcp_recvspace rounded to a multiple of the
                                           mss, which is 1448 in this case), and remains at that
                                           value subsequently (minus data in the buffer), since we
                                           cannot retract a window advertisement.

           The model works by unconstraining rcv_wnd in deliver_in_1/connect_1, since its value is
           determined by a sysctl, hence we want non-determinism. In the case of the first segment
           being received, we need to set rcv_wnd to the value determined by calculate_bsd_rcv_wnd,
           in accordance with that under BSD, in order to set it to the correct value rather than
           the default.

           In subsequent received segments, we do something a little different from BSD, in that we
           update rcv_wnd when we receive a segment, subtracting the length of that segment from the
           window (rather than looking at what was in the receive queue *before* the segment came
           in, as BSD does). We then do the BSD-style update in tcp_output_really, when we're
           working out what window to advertise on the segment we're sending.  This seems a much
           saner thing to do, as it leaves rcv_wnd in a more consistent state, so it's a bit nasty
           that we have to update rcv_wnd in BSD's way, when we get the first segment, but this is
           the only way to change rcv_wnd from the default.

           NOTE: BSD has what seems to be a bit of a bug, in that it updates rcv_wnd before
                 processing the segment, so even if the segment was bad, rcv_wnd gets updated (to
                 the size of the receive buffer).

           NOTE2: Interesting behaviour is that if the local IP is loopback (i.e. 127.0.0.x, and not
                  just the IP of the interface), then the max receive buffer size (so_rcv.sb_hiwat)
                  is rounded to a multiple of the loopback MSS (rather than ethernet MSS), hence the
                  maximum receive buffer size used is 57344 (a multiple of 14336) rather than
                  57920. The model should cope with this, since the value of the receive buffer
                  is not constrained until this point anyway.*)

    (* MS: we need to use the old socket
                  (tcp_sock) in the calculation of the new rcv_wnd, since we update the new socket
                  on the basis of this value. Note that sf' is used, rather than sf, since we need
                  to know the correct value of the receive buffer from calculate_buf_sizes. *)

    TODO3

    @internal

    Under BSD, there is a bug in |tcp_input()|, in that it does not call tcp_mss() to set t_maxseg and
    the buffer sizes, if the received SYN segment did not have the mss option set. Note that this
    only occurs in the case of active/sim opens, since the code in tcp_syncache.c for passive opens
    calls tcp_mss() correctly.

    ** SB: NEGOTIATED options on BSD **

    On the completion of an active open or during a simultaneous open the behavior below for
    timestamping and window scaling is correct (as per RFC1323 Section 1.4). Unfortunately not all
    architectures are fully RFC1323 compliant it seems.

    RFC1323 Section 1.4: "Therefore, for each of the extensions defined below, TCP options will be
    sent on non-SYN segments only when an exchange of options on the SYN segments has indicated that
    both sides understand the extension. Furthermore, an extension option will be sent in a
    <SYN,ACK> segment only if the corresponding option was received in the initial <SYN> segment."

    Linux breaks the condition stated in the second sentence quoted from RFC1323 above. During a
    simultaneous open, on receipt of the remote-ends SYN, a host emits a SYN,ACK segment. Linux adds
    timestamping options to this segment if it has timestamping enabled, regardless of whether the
    received SYN had a timestamp option or not. This is faked up below when we emit the SYN,ACK
    segment and we do not model it here (as the final state is the same once a SYN,ACK has been
    received by this host).

    TODO: is Linux Window Scaling also broken (wrt RFC1323) during a simultaneous open?

    Keith thinks: BSD always listens to a timestamp option, whether or not it was negotiated (i.e.,
    records in cb'), but only generates a reply if it was negotiated and agreed.

    @description

    @internal

    rule is defined by several relations.  Each relates a (before-)socket and a triple:
    (after-)socket, segment list to output, flag.  The flag is T if we should continue and apply the
    remaining relations, and F if we should stop now.  Sorry for the temporality of this
    explanation.

    ((sock',outsegs),continue) is: new socket, segments to output, keep going flag

    No sock with [[sock]] on the listen queue:

    there is no corresponding listening socket, which means that we must have entered SYN_RECEIVED
    due to a simultaneous open, so we want to allow the rule to fire, without updating any listen
    queues.  MS: point of note here; we do NOT test for simultaneous open in this case on the basis
    of whether SYN was set in the segment, as this is not a reliable way of determining the socket's
    state - i.e. we could potentially receive a SYN in the case of a normal passive open, in which
    case we do still want to update the listen queue. The user cannot have a handle on the socket if
    it is in SYN_RECEIVED as part of a passive open, so the only way for it to exist is for the
    listening socket to be present. Therefore it is safe to assume that if no listening socket is
    present, the socket must have entered SYN_RECEIVED by some means other than a passive open,
    i.e. through a simultaneous open.

    Talking about enqueue_oq_list_qinfo:

    NB: we use the relational form of the specification to good effect here, and it feels a bit like
    an attribute grammar.  The specification above decides which segments to emit, but it is the
    enqueueing operation below that decides whether each segment is queued successfully or not.
    Thus the first element of each pair (the message) is constrained above, and the second element
    (the queued flag) is constrained here.  That flag is then used above to decide whether state
    must be rolled back to account for the queueing failure.

  @section [[tcp_output_section]] TCP Output



  A TCP implementation would typically perform output deterministically, e.g.\ during the processing
  a received segment it may construct and enqueue an acknowledgement segment to be emitted.  This
  means that the detailed behaviour of a particular implementation depends on exactly where the
  output routines are called, affecting when segments are emitted.  The contents of an emitted
  segment, on the other hand, must usually be determined by the socket state (especially the
  [[tcpcb]]), not from transient program variables, so that retransmissions can be performed.



  In this specification we choose to be somewhat nondeterministic, loosely specifying when
  common-case TCP output to occur.  This simplifies the modelling of existing implementations
  (avoiding the need to capture the code points at which the output routines are called) and should
  mean the specification is closer to capturing the set of all reasonable implementations.

  A significant defect in the current specification is that it does not impose a very tight lower
  bound on how often output takes place.  The satisfactory dynamic behaviour of TCP connections
  depends on an "ACK clock" property, with receivers  acknowledging data sufficiently often to
  update the sender's send window.  Characterising this may need additional constraints.

  The rule presented in this chapter describes TCP output in the common case, i.e.~the behaviour of
  TCP when emitting a non-SYN, non-RST segment. The whole behaviour is captured by the single rule
  [[deliver_out_1]] which relies upon the auxiliary functions {@link [[tcp_output_required]]} and
  {@link [[tcp_output_really]]}.  Output (strictly, adding segments to the host's output queue) may take
  place whenever this rule can fire; it does construct the output segments purely from the socket state.



% This specification
% allows a little more non-determinism than any given implementation: common case TCP output may
% take place, i.e. rule [[deliver_out_1]] may be applicable, at any time that a socket in the host's
% finite map of sockets is in a compatible state. This was a deliberate design choice that
% simplifies the modelling of existing TCP implementations which may emit segments under different
% conditions. All these may be valid behaviours either with respect to one or more of the TCP RFCs,
% or simply because their behaviour has become widely adopted and accepted. Either way, this rule
% encompasses all the observed behaviour of the implementations and the acceptable behaviour defined
% by the TCP RFCs (SB coughs!).


  The two auxiliary functions are loosely based on BSD's TCP output function, which can be logically
  divided into two halves. The first of these ---to some approximation--- is a guard that prevents
  output from occuring unless it is valid to do so, and the second actually creates a segment and
  passes it to the IP layer for output. This distinction is mirrored in the specification, with [[tcp_output_required]]
  acting as the guard and [[tcp_output_really]] forming the segment ready to be appended to the
  host's output queue. Unfortunately it is not possible to be as clean here as one might hope,
  because under some circumstances [[tcp_output_required]] may have side-effects. It should be noted
  that [[tcp_output_really]] only creates a segment and does not perform any "output" --- the
  act of adding the segment (perhaps unreliably) to the host's output queue is the job of the
  caller.

  The output cases not covered by [[deliver_out_1]] are handled specially and often in a more
  deterministic way. Segments with the SYN flag set are created by the auxiliary functions
  {@link [[make_syn_segment]]} and {@link [[make_syn_ack_segment]]} and are output deterministically in response to
  either user events or segment input. SYN segments are emitted by the rules commonly involved in
  connection establishment, namely [[connect_1]], [[deliver_in_1]], [[deliver_in_2]],
  [[timer_tt_rexmtsyn_1]] and [[timer_tt_rexmt_1]] and are special-cased in this way for clarity
  because connection establishment performs extra work such as option negotiation and state
  initialisation.

  The creation of RST segments is performed by the auxiliaries {@link [[make_rst_segment_from_cb]]} and
  {@link [[make_rst_segment_from_seg]]}, and are used by the rules that require a reset segment to be
  emitted in response to a user event, e.g.\ a [[close()]] call on a socket with a zero linger time,
  or as a socket's response to receiving some types of invalid segment.

  In a few places, mainly in the specification of certain congestion control methods, some rules use
  {@link [[tcp_output_really]]} or the wrapper functions {@link [[tcp_output_perhaps]]} and
  {@link [[mlift_tcp_output_perhaps_or_fail]]} directly and---more importantly---deterministically. This is
  partly for clarity, perhaps because an RFC states that output "MUST" occur at that point, and
  partly for convenience, possibly because the model would require much extra state (hence adding
  unnecessary complexity) if the output function was not used in-place.

  The [[tcp_output_perhaps]] function almost entirely mimics an implementation's TCP output
  function. It calls [[tcp_output_required]] to check that output can take place, applying any
  side-effects that it returns, and finally creates the segment with [[tcp_output_really]].  See
  {@link [[tcp_output_perhaps]]} and {@link [[mlift_tcp_output_perhaps_or_fail]]} for more
  information.

  Other auxiliary functions are involved in TCP output and are described earlier. Once a
  segment has been constructed it is added to the host's output queue by one of {@link [[enqueue_or_fail]]},
  {@link [[enqueue_or_fail_sock]]}, {@link [[enqueue_and_ignore_fail]]}, {@link [[enqueue_each_and_ignore_fail]]} or
  {@link [[mlift_tcp_output_perhaps_or_fail]]}.  These functions are used by [[deliver_out_1]] and other
  rules in the specification to non-deterministically add a segment to the host's output queue. In
  the common case, a segment is added to the host's output queue successfully. In other cases, the
  auxiliary function {@link [[rollback_tcp_output]]} may assert a segment is unroutable and prevent the
  segment from being added to the queue. Some failures are non-deterministic in order to model "out
  of resource" style errors, although most are deterministic routing failures determined from the
  socket and host states. [[rollback_tcp_output]] has a second task to "undo" several of the
  socket's control block changes upon an error condition. Some of the enqueue functions ignore
  failure, e.g. [[enqueue_and_ignore_fail]], and upon an error they just fail to queue the segment
  and do not update the socket with the "rolled-back" control block returned by
  [[rollback_tcp_output]]. %All of these functions are documented towards the end of this chapter.

    @internal

    States in which we may need to do some output, leaving out the connection-establishment states.

    In BSD, we may need to send a FIN from [[SYN_SENT]]/[[SYN_RECEIVED]] so we need to allow this
    rule to fire.

    We'll have other rules to deal with retransmission of SYN and SYN,ACK segments (which will need
    to deal with option negotiation), and to send RST segments.  This rule handles FIN sending.

    [[LAST_ACK]] is included as we may need to resend our FIN there.  [[TIME_WAIT]] is included because we
    may need to re-ACK a repeated FIN (which we would receive if the other end lost our original
    ACK).

    fid is not constrained, given that we want to allow a socket with no fid to send data; for
    example if a listening socket has connected but the user has not yet called accept() we should
    be able to ACK the data. similarly, a closing socket loses its fid, but should still be able to
    send a FIN!

    when we're sending oob data, we want to force out a segment, even if other tests say this would
    probably be silly.  NB: TODO: force implies the rule should be urgent, but we have no timer,
    so in level 2 do not bother

    TODO: going to need another rule to do whatever tcp\_output does when it does not get round to
    sending a segment.  Maybe just setting the persist timer etc?  (in level 3, need to set cwnd if
    idle whenevr tcp\_output gets called, too....)  Must at least do persist\_fun if do\_output is F.

    WORRY: having this rule fire asynchronously is different from BSD.  In BSD, tcp\_output is
    called in specific places, chiefly when a segment is received or when delack fires, thus giving
    rise to the so-called "[[ACK]] clock".

        differ...

        Another possible Level 2 approach would be to remove t_rxtshift and instead have a timer to drop the

        add route caches also; then we could. )


    This looks like a very old comment:

    ( see comment in tcp_output_def above: should force output? )

    ( P: considered folding this into deliver_out_1, as it's not clear why this and the persist timer
    should have different idioms (this a rule and a semaphore; that built into deliver_out_1) and I
    do not like having too many semaphores around. Then changed my mind, as this (and the estimator logic
    that'll be here in Level 3) really seems conceptually different from the out_1 stuff. Hmm. )

   a segment is received and when delack fires.

   In level 4, we should do this too: either in those places that do not do their own output already,
   [[tcp_output]] should be called, or a semaphore should be set to trigger [[deliver_out_1]], which

   This stops the timer and closes the socket.

   Unlike BSD, we take steps to ensure that this timer only fires when it is really time to close
   the socket.  Specifically, we reset it every time we receive a segment while in [[FIN_WAIT_2]],
   to [[TCPTV_MAXIDLE]].  This means we do not need any guarding conditions here; we just do it.

   This means that we do not directly model the BSD behaviour of "sleep for 10 minutes, then check
   every 75 seconds to see if the connection has been idle for 10 minutes".

(*: @section [[time_passage_auxs_section]] ALL Time Passage auxiliaries

   Time passage is a \emph{function}, completely deterministic.
   Any nondeterminism must occur as a result of a tau
   (or other) transition.

   In the present semantics, time passage merely:
     \begin{enumerate}
     \item decrements all timers uniformly

     \item prevents time passage if a timer reaches zero

     \item prevents time passage if an urgent action is
        enabled.
     \end{enumerate}
   We model the first two points with functions [[Time_Pass_*]], for various types
   [[*]].  These functions return an option type: if the result is NONE then
   time may not pass for the given duration.  Essentially they pick out everything in a host state of type [['a timed]], and do something with it.

   We treat the last point in the rule {@link [[epsilon_1]]} itself, below.
